00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
这一章节的《Wolfram 笔记本介绍》

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,500
是关于在不同的平台上使用笔记本的

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,800
特别是在 Cloud 和在移动设备上

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,000
像是平板电脑和智能手机

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,500
比如说 这里是一个平板电脑上的笔记本

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,700
通过免费的 Wolfram Player 应用展示

7
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,600
在这个应用中你可以滚动笔记本

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,000
双击单元组括号

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,600
来打开和关闭单元

10
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,500
像 Wolfram 桌面端一样

11
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,200
而且这个笔记本也可变成动态的文件

12
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,300
所以比如说 你可以调整动态内容

13
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,800
像是这里的按钮和滑动条

14
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,000
Wolfram Player 应用中 交互式的操控内容

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,400
在屏幕底部展示

16
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,100
因为移动设备的控制

17
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,000
主要由手指触摸实现

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,100
而不是鼠标 并且手指可以阻挡展示的内容

19
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,200
所以在屏幕底部有控制栏

20
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,500
可以同时让观看展示

21
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,600
和进行控制更加简单

22
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,200
你可以使用 Wolfram Cloud 应用而不是 Wolfram Player

23
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,000
来创建或者编辑一个笔记本

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
比如说 这里展示了同一个笔记本

25
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,500
在 Wolfram Cloud 应用中的样子

26
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,500
包括编辑笔记本的控制选项

27
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,800
这些控制选项在这里使用来插入一个新的文本单元

28
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,500
编辑的具体操作会在稍后被说明

29
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,400
Wolfram Player 和 Wolfram Cloud 应用

30
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,900
在智能手机上也可以被使用

31
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,800
比如说 这是那个笔记本在手机上被展示

32
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,700
使用 Wolfram Player 应用

33
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,400
除了屏幕的大小不同

34
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,700
它与在平板电脑上没有什么区别

35
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:27,000
包括按钮和滑动条这些动态内容

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,800
笔记本也可以在网页浏览器中被展示和编辑

37
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,800
使用连接到互联网

38
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,600
或者合适的 Cloud 上的任何电脑

39
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,100
比如说 这里展示了电脑浏览器中

40
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,000
一个网页上的笔记本

41
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,650
它被登录到了免费 Wolfram Cloud 账户中

42
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:43,600
互动性的操作在这里也可以被实现

43
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,400
笔记本在这也可以被编辑

44
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:50,200
例如添加一个新的文本单元和做计算

45
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,000
当然 笔记本可以在

46
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
普通的电脑应用中被展示

47
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,400
比如说 这里展示了

48
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,000
 Wolfram 桌面端中的笔记本

49
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,100
笔记本文件的基础

50
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,900
在所有平台中都相同

51
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,800
在手机端 在网页浏览器中

52
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,100
或者在桌面端

53
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,800
相同的笔记本可以在任何平台下被打开

54
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,500
比如说 从桌面端的这个笔记本开始 你可以选择

55
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,200
保存到 Wolfram Cloud (Save to Cloud)

56
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,800
来在 Cloud 账号中保存

57
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,700
如果桌面端应用没有登入

58
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,700
Wolfram Cloud 账号 你会被要求登入

59
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,300
之后你可以选择一个名称

60
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,800
来在那个账号中保存笔记本

61
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,800
Cloud 中的笔记本

62
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,600
可以在任何平台中被打开

63
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,000
比如说 回到平板电脑

64
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,950
在安装 Wolfram Player 应用后

65
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,950
你可以启动这个应用 它将会展示

66
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:37,000
保存在这个设备里的笔记本

67
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
想要看到刚才

68
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,300
被上传到 Cloud 的那个笔记本

69
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,900
你可以点击屏幕左上角的按钮

70
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,100
打开侧边栏 点击 Add Cloud Account

71
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,900
然后使用这个对话框来登入 Cloud 账户

72
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,200
The notebook that was
just saved to the cloud

73
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,200
was saved in the home directory
of that account,

74
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,800
so navigate to that directory
and open the notebook.

75
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,700
There are buttons in the upper-
right corner of this window

76
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,800
for various operations
with this notebook.

77
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,000
Tapping the button
with letters on it

78
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,500
opens a small dialog box

79
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,600
that is used here to make
the display a little bit bigger,

80
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,300
which results in the display
that was shown earlier.

81
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,200
This notebook currently exists
in the cloud,

82
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,100
but you can also save
the notebook locally

83
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,400
on this tablet computer
by tapping this button

84
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,000
in the upper-right corner
of the window,

85
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,200
which opens a dialog box
with various choices.

86
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,200
To save the notebook
on this tablet,

87
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,800
tap Save to Files,
which opens a dialog box

88
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,000
for choosing where
to save the notebook.

89
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,500
With the notebook saved
on this tablet,

90
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,000
you could sign out
of the cloud account

91
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,500
and even disconnect
from the internet

92
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,200
and still view the notebook.

93
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,300
The basic programs for
interacting with this notebook

94
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,000
are all running locally
on this tablet,

95
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,600
which makes these operations
significantly faster,

96
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,800
since it avoids the overhead
of running over the internet,

97
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,500
and dynamic content like buttons
and sliders will also work.

98
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,500
Working without being connected
to the internet, of course,

99
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,000
requires that nothing
in these operations

100
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,500
either directly or indirectly
tries to access the internet.

101
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,300
In this particular notebook,
the earthquake data, for example,

102
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:59,700
has to be included
in the notebook.

103
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,500
To edit the notebook
still on the tablet,

104
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,000
you can start by launching
the Wolfram Cloud app.

105
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,500
After logging into the account,
you can tap to open the notebook.

106
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,600
The display includes

107
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,800
the same font magnification
button as the Wolfram Player app.

108
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,500
Editing the notebook
to insert a new cell

109
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,400
starts much as it does
on the desktop

110
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,950
by clicking, or in this case

111
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:21,000
tapping, to get
a cell insertion bar,

112
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,600
which also brings up
a row of buttons

113
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,500
at the bottom of the screen.

114
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,950
To enter a calculation,
tap the Input cell button,

115
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:29,000
which creates a new Input cell

116
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,500
and also brings up
a special keyboard

117
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,400
for entering input.

118
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,000
You can use the keyboard
to enter the input

119
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,700
and then tap the evaluate button
to do the calculation.

120
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:38,900
To get a Text cell,

121
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,600
tap the new cell button
and choose Plain Text,

122
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,100
which creates a Text cell
and opens a keyboard

123
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,800
for entering the contents
of the cell.

124
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,400
Other types of cells
can be entered

125
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,800
by choosing Styled Text
from the new cell menu.

126
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,800
For example,

127
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,400
you can choose Section
to get a Section cell

128
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,100
and then enter the contents
of the cell.

129
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,100
Selecting cell brackets

130
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,450
brings up a different row
of buttons

131
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:02,000
for copying or pasting
or cutting cells.

132
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,400
For example, this shows
using the Cut button

133
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,200
to delete the cells
that were just entered.

134
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,000
Finally as was shown earlier,
Wolfram Notebooks

135
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
can also be edited
using a web browser.

136
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,700
You can start
at the Wolfram Cloud website.

137
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,900
Log in to your
Wolfram Cloud Account

138
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,600
and navigate to the notebook
that you want to edit.

139
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,900
Here you can enter calculations

140
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,300
by clicking in the notebook
to get a cell insertion bar,

141
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,000
enter the calculation
using the keyboard

142
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,700
and press SHIFT+ENTER
to do the calculation.

143
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,400
Many features of Wolfram Desktop
are also available here,

144
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,800
including, for example,
the Suggestions Bar

145
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,400
below the output.

146
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,200
Keyboard shortcuts can be used
for choosing new cell styles.

147
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,550
For example, you can type

148
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:42,300
the keyboard shortcut
for a new Text cell

149
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,000
and enter the contents
of the cell.

150
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Another way of choosing
the style of a new cell

151
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,500
is to click the Format button
at the top of the window,

152
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,800
which opens a side panel
with controls for choosing fonts

153
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,600
and cell styles and so on.

154
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,000
For example,
to get a Section cell,

155
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,700
you can choose Section
from the Cell Style menu

156
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:02,700
and enter the contents
of the cell.

157
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,800
For just getting started
with Wolfram Notebooks,

158
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,500
Wolfram Cloud is in some ways
the easiest place to begin,

159
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,200
because usually
there's nothing to install.

160
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,600
All you need is a web browser

161
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,500
on a computer
connected to the internet.

162
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,700
For example,
you can open a web browser

163
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:18,500
and go to the Wolfram webpage,
www.wolfram.com,

164
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,000
which shows the whole range
of products.

165
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,300
One of those products
is Wolfram Programming Lab,

166
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,100
which is a good place for
learning the Wolfram Language.

167
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,200
Choosing Wolfram Programming Lab
opens a notebook

168
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,000
with some sample
Wolfram Language programs,

169
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,600
but to just get a new notebook,

170
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,300
you can click
the Create New Notebook button

171
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,700
or choose New Notebook
from the File menu

172
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,800
to get a new notebook

173
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,700
in the Wolfram Cloud |
Open Access system,

174
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,400
where you can enter content
and do calculations

175
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:47,000
much as you might do
in any other Wolfram Notebook.

176
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
After creating the notebook,

177
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,800
you can save the notebook
in the cloud,

178
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,000
which would of course require
logging into a cloud account,

179
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
or you can choose Download
from the File menu

180
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
to download the notebook
to a desktop system.

181
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,800
That's the end of the examples
for this section.

182
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,400
The basic features
of Wolfram Notebooks

183
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,300
work much the same
across all of these platforms,

184
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,800
but for features
that are different

185
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,800
on different platforms,

186
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,600
a good place to look
for more information

187
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,900
is the workflow guides
in the Wolfram documentation,

188
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:13,900
which gives separate

189
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,200
step-by-step instructions
for each platform.

190
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,300
For example, here is a page
of workflow guides

191
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,700
on working in notebooks,

192
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,900
and in this page
on creating a Text cell,

193
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,500
you can choose instructions
for the desktop platform

194
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,400
or for Wolfram Cloud

195
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,500
or for mobile devices
like tablets and smartphones.
