00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,400
这一章节的《Wolfram 笔记本介绍》

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,200
是关于使用程序和模板

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,300
来自动产生笔记本和文档

4
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,600
自动产生文档在实际应用中很有用

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,700
比如处理那些以某种方式重复的文档

6
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,200
就像这里展示出的一系列报告

7
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,950
或者是处理有相同内容的文档

8
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:16,950
像是这个笔记本

9
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,400
或者是应用于一些更加专业的场景

10
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,400
像是处理按日程编写的报告

11
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,000
处理计算合同

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,900
或者只是记录长时间运行的程序结果

13
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,900
待会将要详细介绍的

14
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,100
一个处理报告的基本过程

15
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:34,000
会从创建一个像这样的简单模板笔记本开始

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,300
然后用那个模板填充信息

17
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,300
去产生一个文件

18
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,450
这个输入用了 GenerateDocument 函数

19
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:42,500
和被保存在文件中的

20
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,300
模板里的名称参数

21
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,600
另一个产生文件的更低级的方式

22
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,000
是写一个这样的程序

23
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,650
含有 CreateDocument 和 NotebookWrite 函数

24
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:52,900
去产生一个笔记本文件

25
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:55,500
然后在这个笔记本中插入内容

26
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,100
产生笔记本的任何方式

27
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,500
基本上都是可能的

28
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,900
因为 Wolfram 笔记本

29
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,400
是由 Wolfram 语言表达的

30
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,000
而且可以被 Wolfram 语言程序

31
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
创建和修改

32
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
将一个笔记本描述为一系列单元(Cell)

33
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
字面上是说这个笔记本的内容

34
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,450
是一个 Wolfram 语言中的列表(List)

35
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:14,200
拥有很多个单元(Cell)表达式作为元素

36
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,000
比如 这里是一个笔记本的表达式

37
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
拥有三个单元(Cell)

38
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
和指定笔记本窗口顶端标题、窗口大小

39
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,800
的选项

40
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,800
使用 NotebookPut 函数

41
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,500
这个表达式可以作为一个笔记本被展示

42
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,900
直接输入笔记本表达式

43
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,300
不是笔记本被创建的方式

44
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,425
但是笔记本最终完成于

45
00:01:33,425 --> 00:01:36,800
笔记本表达式的操作

46
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,300
其中一个操作就是 CreateNotebook 函数

47
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,800
用在这里去创建一个新的笔记本表达式

48
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,200
然后在计算机屏幕上展示

49
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,000
这个输入同时分配了笔记本对象

50
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,800
和变量的值

51
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,800
将内容输入进笔记本的一个方式

52
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,700
是用 NotebookWrite 函数

53
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:56,300
将单元(Cell)表达式插入笔记本

54
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,900
All of the general programming
features of the Wolfram Language

55
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,000
can also be used
in generating notebooks.

56
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,700
For example,
starting with some data

57
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,000
to form the basis for a report,

58
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
here is a program
that creates a new notebook,

59
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,800
writes a title cell
into that notebook

60
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,300
and then uses
NotebookWrite commands in a loop

61
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,300
to generate a notebook

62
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:17,100
with a section for each element
in the data list.

63
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,000
Beyond CreateNotebook
and NotebookWrite,

64
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,500
there are many other functions
for manipulating notebooks.

65
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,600
You can find more information
about those functions

66
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,450
in the Wolfram documentation,
such as in this page

67
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:29,000
on manipulating notebooks
from the kernel.

68
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,900
There are functions here
for moving around

69
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,050
and searching within a notebook,

70
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:34,700
for inserting
and deleting content,

71
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,300
for opening and closing
notebooks, and so on.

72
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,200
Basically almost anything
that can be done

73
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,800
by interactively editing
this notebook

74
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,500
can also be done from a program.

75
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,100
A more graphical way
of generating notebooks

76
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,600
is the method mentioned earlier

77
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,600
of starting with
a template notebook like this one

78
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,300
and inserting content
within that template.

79
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,000
A template notebook
can be created by choosing New ►

80
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Programmatic Notebook ►

81
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Template Notebook
from the File menu,

82
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,800
which opens a new notebook
with a toolbar in a docked cell

83
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,700
at the top of the notebook.

84
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:03,750
Except for the toolbar,

85
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,800
this notebook can be edited
much like any other notebook.

86
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,500
The report is completed
either by inserting expressions

87
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,000
at locations called slots
within this notebook

88
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,200
or by doing evaluations
within the template

89
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,200
when the report is generated.

90
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,400
You can add a slot
by clicking the Slot button,

91
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,000
which opens a dialog box
for entering the name of the slot,

92
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,600
and you can optionally enter
default values for each slot.

93
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,900
After finishing the template,

94
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,300
you can click the Generate button
to generate a report

95
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:32,300
with the slots filled in
by the default values,

96
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,300
which is useful for checking
that the template

97
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,700
is giving the expected result.

98
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,500
The template notebook
can also be saved for later use

99
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,500
like any other notebook

100
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,900
by choosing Save
under the File menu.

101
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,700
After creating the template,
there are several tools

102
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,000
for filling in the slots
in the template.

103
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,500
One of those tools
is the GenerateDocument function,

104
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,400
shown here with the name
of the saved template notebook

105
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,400
as the first argument
and a list of rules giving values

106
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,600
for the named template slots
as the second argument.

107
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,500
The result is a report
with the template slots

108
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,800
filled in with
the specified values.

109
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,300
Rather than
evaluating expressions

110
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:09,200
and inserting the results
into slots in the template,

111
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,800
it is also possible,
and often makes

112
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,300
the document-generation process
somewhat easier,

113
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:16,000
to do those evaluations
right within the template.

114
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
For example,
the DateString expression

115
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,600
in that GenerateDocument input,

116
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,400
which is evaluated
to get a result

117
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,000
that is inserted into a slot
in the template,

118
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
could alternatively be included
right in the template

119
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,300
using the Expression button
in the template toolbar.

120
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,600
Clicking the Expression button
gives a box

121
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,000
where you can enter
an expression to be evaluated

122
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,900
when the document generated.

123
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,600
After saving
the revised template,

124
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,800
we can return
to the GenerateDocument input,

125
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,800
where the DateString expression
is no longer needed.

126
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,000
When the document is generated,

127
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,600
the output from evaluating
the DateString expression

128
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,300
in the template is inserted

129
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,300
and the document looks
just as it did before,

130
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:54,600
but that GenerateDocument input
is a bit less complicated.

131
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,000
Reports can be much more
elaborate than this one

132
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,600
and can include tables
and graphs and anything else

133
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,000
that can be included
in any notebook.

134
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,100
For example, here is a plot
using data from a dataset

135
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,500
that is loaded
from an external file.

136
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,000
This plot can be added
to the report

137
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,500
by including another slot
in the template, as shown here;

138
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,000
saving the revised template;

139
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,400
then moving over
to the GenerateDocument input

140
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,600
to enter a value
for the new named slot

141
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,000
and evaluating that input
to generate the report.

142
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,500
As was used earlier
for the DateString expression,

143
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,000
the programming to load the data
and generate the plot

144
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
in that example
can also be put in the template.

145
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
A direct way of doing that

146
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,500
is to simply edit the template
to add the inputs

147
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,300
to load the data
and generate the plot.

148
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,500
If we click the Generate button
for this template,

149
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,200
the inputs and outputs
are all included in the report.

150
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,800
If the report
only needs to show the plot,

151
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,800
the inputs can be omitted
with the help of items

152
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,500
under the Cell Behavior menu
in the report template toolbar.

153
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,600
To evaluate
and then delete the cell

154
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,200
with the input
for loading the data,

155
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,100
select that cell
and choose Evaluate and Delete

156
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,400
from the Cell Behavior menu.

157
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,300
For the cell with the input
that generates the plot,

158
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,400
we could again choose
Evaluate and Delete,

159
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,800
which would show the plot
and delete the input,

160
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,600
or we can choose
Evaluate and Hide.

161
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,750
Clicking the Generate button

162
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,800
shows the effect
of those settings.

163
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,900
The cell for loading the data,

164
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,000
which was set to
Evaluate and Delete,

165
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,900
was evaluated and deleted,

166
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,300
and the cell
for generating the plot,

167
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,400
which was set to
Evaluate and Hide,

168
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,200
gives the plot shown
in a closed cell group.

169
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,500
Double-clicking on the closed
cell group bracket

170
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,600
opens that cell group
to show the input,

171
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,950
which can be useful
if users of the report

172
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:34,000
might want to see that input.

173
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Other choices
for cell behavior are

174
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,600
Leave Unevaluated,
which copies the chosen cell

175
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,400
over to the report
without doing any evaluation,

176
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,500
and Exclude Cell,
which omits the cell

177
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,600
from the report,
also without evaluating it,

178
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,500
which is useful
for saving notes and comments

179
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,000
that are not part of the report.

180
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,500
The programming in that example
brings up a technical detail

181
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,900
that can sometimes be important
to know about,

182
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,600
which is that the notebooks
for the report template

183
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,000
and for the generated report

184
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
have an option setting

185
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,900
that causes new variables
to be assigned a context

186
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,000
that is unique to each notebook.

187
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,900
The new variable in question
in this example

188
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,800
is the data variable.

189
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,000
By default, the context
of new variables

190
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,800
is global in all notebooks,

191
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,500
so a new variable
in one notebook

192
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,150
is the same as a variable
with that same name

193
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,800
in another notebook.

194
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,500
In this generated notebook,
however,

195
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,500
the context is unique
to this notebook,

196
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,400
so values assigned
to this variable

197
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,400
in this notebook

198
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,600
have no effect on variables
with the same name

199
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,000
in another notebook.

200
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,700
Normally this is
desirable behavior,

201
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,100
but if report generation
is for some reason set up

202
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,300
to depend on
global names for variables,

203
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,300
then it is necessary
to specify the context explicitly

204
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,000
or to otherwise arrange
for those variables

205
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
to use the same context.

206
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
The most common reason
for creating a template

207
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,900
is for creating
more than one report,

208
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,000
which in part means
being careful to program

209
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,200
into the template
only the content and formatting

210
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,500
that is common
to all of the reports.

211
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,000
As an example, consider
generating a separate report

212
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
for each record in the dataset
that was loaded earlier.

213
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,300
That dataset consists
of a list of records

214
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,700
and the example template
is programmed to show

215
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,500
only the first record.

216
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,800
This data happens
to be in the form

217
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,700
of a Wolfram Language dataset,

218
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,900
from which it is easy
to extract an expression

219
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:15,400
called an association
for the elements in each record.

220
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,500
This association can be used
in the GenerateDocument function,

221
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,700
just like the list of rules
that was used earlier

222
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,100
for named slots in a template.

223
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,900
To make the template work
with this dataset,

224
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,100
we can modify the template

225
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,700
so that the names of the named
slots in the template

226
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,300
match the names
of the named items

227
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,400
in each record in the dataset.

228
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,900
After saving the revised template,

229
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,700
the GenerateDocument function
can be used with the association

230
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:40,000
extracted from the dataset
to generate a report.

231
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,300
Applying the Normal function
to the entire dataset

232
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:45,600
gives a list of associations
for each record,

233
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,700
and each association
has the names and values to use

234
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:52,500
in the GenerateDocument function
to generate the document.

235
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,400
All that remains now
is to write a short program

236
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,000
to apply
the GenerateDocument function

237
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,500
to each element in that list,

238
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,300
which results in a separate
report being generated

239
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,900
for each record in the dataset.

240
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,800
Rather than creating
separate reports,

241
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,400
a report based on this dataset

242
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,400
could alternatively
be a single document

243
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,700
with a separate section
for each record in the dataset.

244
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,100
One way of generating
such a report

245
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,500
uses the Repeating Block feature
in the template toolbar.

246
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,400
To demonstrate
how repeating block works

247
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,600
in a simple example,

248
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,000
here is a template
with two cells.

249
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,300
To repeat these two cells,
select the cell bracket

250
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,000
and click
the Repeating Block button,

251
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,800
which opens a dialog box
with several choices.

252
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,800
Here we will demonstrate
only the second choice,

253
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,300
which specifies
that this template

254
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,400
will use a variable named data

255
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,500
and that the value
of that variable

256
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,700
will be a list for filling in
the slots in each block.

257
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:43,500
A GenerateDocument input to use
this template can look like this,

258
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,300
where the value
of the data variable

259
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,500
is a list of associations

260
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,300
and each association
gives a list of named values

261
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:52,100
for filling in the slots
in each block.

262
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,100
In this example,

263
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,000
the value of the data variable
has three elements,

264
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,200
so the block will be repeated
three times in the report.

265
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,900
Returning to
the previous dataset,

266
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,000
rather than applying
GenerateDocument separately

267
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,300
to each record in the dataset,

268
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,300
this time the entire list
of associations

269
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,300
from that dataset

270
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,700
will be passed
to the GenerateDocument function

271
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,000
as the value of the variable
named data.

272
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Now modify the earlier template

273
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,300
to use a repeating block
with named slots

274
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,800
that match the names
of the elements in each record.

275
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,900
After that modification,

276
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,600
the GenerateDocument program
to create the report

277
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,000
is just a single line of input.

278
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,300
All of the formatting
and interactive features

279
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,500
of notebooks that have come up
in earlier sections

280
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,300
can also be used in
automatically generated reports.

281
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,700
For example,
here is a template

282
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,600
that uses the Grid function
to show data in a table

283
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,500
and a TabView input

284
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:43,000
so that users of the report
can choose between different plots.

285
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,700
The report generated
from that template

286
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,300
is an interactive report
with a summary table

287
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,500
and an interactive feature

288
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,000
for selecting different
information to display.

289
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,200
That's the end of the examples
for this section.

290
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,300
There are many variations

291
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,800
on the basic
report-generation process.

292
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,300
In the Wolfram documentation,
you can find more information

293
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,900
by searching
for report generation.

294
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,300
For example, this guide page

295
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:07,200
gives links to the functions
that came up in the section

296
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,950
and also functions for doing
document generation in the cloud

297
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:10,950
and for such things

298
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:14,000
as generating reports
automatically on a schedule.

299
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
There are also workflow guides
with step-by-step instructions

300
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
for the basic process

301
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,300
of generating a report
from a template

302
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:24,500
and for generating a report
on schedule or as a PDF file.
