00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
这一章节的《 Wolfram 笔记本介绍》的内容

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,800
是使用笔记本进行演示

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,500
例如以幻灯片的形式显示笔记本

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,400
这里是一个典型的幻灯片的例子

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,900
它本质上只是一个笔记本

6
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:13,500
并且每次显示一张幻灯片

7
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,500
你可以通过点击显示屏右上角的这个按钮

8
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,400
(-)

9
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,700
待对照！！！然后在弹出的菜单中选择" "来结束幻灯片放映

10
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,800
这样会在工作格式下显示同一个笔记本

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,400
这个笔记本用来创建幻灯片

12
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,900
This working slideshow notebook

13
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,400
和其他的笔记本几乎一样

14
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,900
不过有两个基本的区别

15
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:33,200
一是两张幻灯片之间有幻灯片分隔线 (Slide Break) 单元

16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,000
二是是笔记本顶部会显示创作工具栏

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,900
！！不通顺：创作工具栏是一个停靠在顶端的单元
The authoring toolbar is a docked cell

18
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,800
带有常见操作的控件

19
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,400
例如插入新幻灯片页面、开始演示

20
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,600
The authoring toolbar and the Slide Break cells

21
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,900
还有其他所有能让笔记本能够作为创建幻灯片环境的功能

22
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,600
(-)

23
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,500
是在 stylesheet. 中设置的

24
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,800
这个笔记本的 stylesheet 

25
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,000
是在 PresenterTools 子菜单中选择的

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,300
该子菜单位于 Format ► Stylesheet 

27
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,000
All of the stylesheets in the PresenterTools submenu

28
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
包括创建幻灯片所需的所有选项

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,450
实际上  任何一个笔记本都可以做成幻灯片

30
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:09,600
只需要选择 PresenterTools stylesheets 中的一个选项

31
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,400
并且插入幻灯片分隔线单元

32
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,100
例如  这里是和刚才同样的笔记本

33
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,200
但是没有幻灯片分界线单元

34
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,500
并且采用的是 normal Default stylesheet,

35
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:21,000
也就是在 stylesheet 子菜单中选中的项目

36
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,800
菜单的下方是 PresenterTools 子菜单

37
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,800
再下方有一个名为 SlideShow 的子菜单

38
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,450
这里包含的 SlideShow 子菜单是为了

39
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:30,300
提供对旧版本幻灯片系统的支持

40
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,300
它已经在 Wolfram 笔记本中存在多年了

41
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,300
(-)

42
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,000
但是本节课程是关于更新的 PresenterTools 系统的

43
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,100
它是旧系统的增强版

44
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,800
要把笔记本做成幻灯片

45
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,300
我们需要选择 PresenterTools stylesheets 中的一个选项

46
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,250
一个便捷的插入幻灯片分界线的方式

47
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,300
是首先打开创作工具栏

48
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,900
它可以通过在“格式”菜单的“显示屏环境”子菜单内将屏幕环境改为 Slideshow Working 来调出

49
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,950
(-)

50
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:55,300
(-)2

51
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,000
然后点击创作工具栏上的“插入新幻灯片”按钮

52
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
打开一个小的浮动菜单

53
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,200
提供插入不带背景的幻灯片分隔或带背景的幻灯片分隔两个选项

54
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,000
无论哪种选择都会插入幻灯片中断

55
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,800
它被一个新的具有名为幻灯片导航栏的格式的单元所标记
which is marked by a new cell with a cell style called slideshow navigation bar.

56
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,000
(-)

57
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,500
你也可以通过从幻灯片其他位置复制粘贴幻灯片分界线单元来创建新幻灯片

58
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,800
(-)

59
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,400
(-)2

60
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,700
例如  我们可以选中幻灯片分界线单元

61
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,800
和下方的 Section 单元

62
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,750
接着复制所选单元  再将它们粘贴在笔记本其他部位

63
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,000
来获得新的一页幻灯片

64
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,200
编辑幻灯片的方式还包括删除幻灯片

65
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,600
或删除幻灯片分界线

66
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,000
例如  为了删除刚才新增的幻灯片页面

67
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
我们可以选中幻灯片分界线单元

68
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,300
和幻灯片的内容然后删掉所选项

69
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,000
另外一种在整个笔记本中插入幻灯片分界线的方式

70
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
(-)

71
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
是单击创作工具栏上的 Slide Break Defaults  按钮

72
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,700
(-)

73
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,000
这会打开一个对话框

74
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,300
在这个对话框中你可以根据单元格的样式选择幻灯片分割线

75
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,300
例如  选择对话框中的 Section

76
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,800
然后点击设置来在笔记本中每一个 Section 单元前插入幻灯片分界线

77
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,500
(-)

78
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,800
！！不通顺：如果笔记本已经组织成章节 If the notebook is already organized into sections,

79
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,000
这是把笔记本转换成幻灯片的捷径

80
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,750
相比转换默认的笔记本到幻灯片

81
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:05,825
(-)

82
00:03:05,825 --> 00:03:06,825
在多数情况下

83
00:03:06,825 --> 00:03:08,300
创建新幻灯片最方便的方法

84
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:11,000
是从“文件”菜单下 “新建” ► Presenter Notebook 开始

85
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
(-)

86
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
这会打开一个对话框

87
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,950
for choosing from the same set of PresenterTools stylesheets,

88
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:19,500
在这里它们叫做主题

89
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,600
从这个对话框理你还可以选择

90
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,500
各种预设字体格式和配色方案

91
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,900
做出一些选择后

92
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,400
单击“创建”按钮以获得一个幻灯片模板

93
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,500
带有所选的 PresenterTools stylesheet

94
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,500
显示屏自动环境设置为 Slideshow Working

95
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,800
创作工具栏显示在顶部  一些幻灯片

96
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,900
已经被填充了通用的内容

97
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,300
这一笔记本可以和其他任何笔记本一样被编辑

98
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:44,500
以填充幻灯片的内容

99
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,200
创作工具栏上的一些按钮

100
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,500
是控制字体和样式的通用部件

101
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,300
它们可以用于任何笔记本

102
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,250
例如  这个按钮会打开选择单元样式的菜单

103
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:53,600
(-)

104
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,600
这与在“格式”菜单的 Style 子菜单中的可选项相同

105
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,200
(-)

106
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,750
单元格式菜单旁边

107
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,400
是一个有趣的按钮  它可以被用来

108
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,900
将字体设置应用到所有具有相同格式的单元

109
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:05,900
例如

110
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:09,000
在我们设置这一文本单元使用大字号、粗体后

111
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,600
点击这个按钮就会有

112
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,050
将这些选项应用到该笔记本里所有文本单元的效果

113
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,300
(-)

114
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,550
你也可以
This worked by editing the private stylesheet

115
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:17,550
for this notebook.

116
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:18,550
例如

117
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,500
选择“格式”菜单下 Edit Stylesheet

118
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,800
会显示本笔记本内的 private stylesheet 

119
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,500
和新的本地样式定义

120
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,500
这些定义为文本指定了大的粗体字

121
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,700
你可以通过直接编辑样式表来达到同样的效果

122
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,400
(-)

123
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,400
所以在创作工具栏中的按钮

124
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,700
基本上

125
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,200
用于一键修改样式表

126
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,000
有一个按钮是值得说几句的  按下这个按钮

127
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
会打开一个浮动菜单

128
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,800
用来调大或调小字号

129
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,500
要描述该菜单的作用  我们需要首先介绍一下

130
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,800
所有 PresenterTools stylesheets 的功能

131
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,750
它可以根据窗口大小动态调整内容的尺寸

132
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,800
(-)

133
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,300
例如  如果窗口的大小改变了

134
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,300
文本的字号也会随之改变  图片也有同样的效果

135
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,800
几乎所有笔记本中其他的内容

136
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,300
都会随之窗口的大小而改变

137
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,100
你可以在任何一个笔记本中获得同样的效果

138
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:07,800
只需要调整字体、图片等的缩放比例

139
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,900
但是与其他大部分 stylesheets 不同 

140
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,000
在 RresenterTools stylesheets 中所有关于缩放的选项

141
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,500
都已经是这个 stylesheet 的一部分

142
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,700
像这样的动态缩放

143
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,600
通常情况下很有帮助

144
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,950
譬如在你想扩大演示界面的窗口

145
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:23,800
或者是在不同窗口大小的显示系统上进行演示的情况下

146
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,300
(-)

147
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:29,300
现在让我们回到字体大小的问题上

148
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:32,500
如果字体大小通过选中一些文字

149
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,100
然后在“格式”菜单的 Size 子菜单选则某个字号的方式指定

150
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,600
(-)

151
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,600
那么当窗口的大小发生变化时   该文本的大小将保持不变

152
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,800
(-)

153
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,800
因为这种大小设置优先于

154
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,000
 stylesheet 的动态缩放系统

155
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
创作工具栏上的字体大小按钮

156
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,100
的工作方式不同

157
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:52,950
例如  选中一些字符然后在创作工具栏的浮动菜单中选择一个新的大小

158
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:55,300
(-)

159
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,400
会使选中的文字的字号按所选步长的比例放大或缩小
to be scaled up or down by the chosen number of steps,

160
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,900
(-)

161
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,900
and the resized text does change size

162
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,800
based on the size of the window.

163
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,300
Similar issues also apply to images and to graphics.

164
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,000
For example, selecting this image

165
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,500
changes the authoring toolbar

166
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,400
to show a button for locking the current size of the image

167
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,300
or letting the size of the image change

168
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,000
with the size of the window.

169
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,700
Choosing Lock to current size

170
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,800
sets the image size option for that selection

171
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,300
to the current fixed value,

172
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,500
which results in an image that, like the text shown earlier,

173
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,000
remains at a fixed size

174
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
when the size of the window is changed.

175
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
So while dynamic resizing is the default,

176
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,400
you can get fixed sizes by specifying sizes

177
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,800
for individual selections.

178
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,500
Other buttons in the authoring toolbar

179
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,300
include the Start Presentation button,

180
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,800
which is the button to click to start the presentation,

181
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,500
which we will do in a moment.

182
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,900
The first button below the Start Presentation button

183
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,000
brings up a palette of buttons

184
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,200
showing the outline of the slideshow.

185
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,500
These buttons can be clicked

186
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,000
to navigate between slides in the notebook.

187
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,500
This palette also includes a refresh button

188
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,500
to update the palette if slides are added or removed.

189
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,300
The button next to that opens the Side Notes palette,

190
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,000
which provides a way of adding notes

191
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,300
that are intended for the presenter

192
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,400
and that will be shown in this palette,

193
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,000
but that are not displayed in the presentation.

194
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,500
To add a side note,

195
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,000
click the Add note to slide button,

196
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,100
which inserts a cell called a SideNote cell

197
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,000
into the slideshow notebook.

198
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,600
This cell can be edited just like any other cell.

199
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,800
Clicking the refresh button updates the Side Notes palette

200
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,000
with any new side notes.

201
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,300
Clicking this last button opens a popup menu.

202
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,100
Choosing Style Palette from that menu

203
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,400
opens a palette of buttons

204
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,500
like the buttons in the authoring toolbar.

205
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,300
Choosing Presentation Controls

206
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,500
opens a dialog box for customizing the computer keys

207
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,500
for navigating between slides.

208
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,200
Choosing Theme Options opens the same dialog box

209
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,500
that was used initially for choosing a stylesheet.

210
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,300
So if you wanted to change the stylesheet

211
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,800
from the stylesheet that was chosen initially,

212
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,100
you can do that here,

213
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,600
or equivalently, by choosing a different stylesheet

214
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,400
from the Stylesheet submenu.

215
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,300
For example, this changes the fonts

216
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,000
and the color scheme of the presentation

217
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
by changing the stylesheet.

218
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,400
To start the slideshow,

219
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,500
we can click the Start Presentation button.

220
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,000
At the end of the Start Presentation button

221
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,900
is a popup menu for other screen environments.

222
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,800
Scrolling Presentation gives a display

223
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,400
for scrolling through the slides

224
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,500
rather than clicking from slide to slide,

225
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,800
and Slideshow Presentation

226
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,100
switches the screen environment to Slideshow Presentation,

227
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,000
which removes the authoring toolbar

228
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
and the Slide Break cells and the SideNote cells.

229
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Clicking the main Start Presentation button

230
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,200
does all of that

231
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,500
and also switches to full-screen display.

232
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,900
After the presentation is started,

233
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,000
you can move between slides

234
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,900
using keys on the computer keyboard

235
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,900
or the corresponding keys on a separate controller.

236
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,400
Within the slideshow, there is a button

237
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,000
in the upper-right corner of the window

238
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
that can be clicked

239
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,800
to open a popup menu with other controls.

240
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,800
There are choices here for moving to the first slide

241
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,000
or to the next slide and so on.

242
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Choosing Toggle Navigation Bar adds on-screen controls

243
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
at the top of the window for moving between slides.

244
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,100
Choosing Toggle Style Tools opens the same palette

245
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,300
of style controls that was shown earlier.

246
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,000
In Slideshow Working screen environment,

247
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,650
this palette isn't usually needed since the same controls

248
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:10,800
are available in the authoring toolbar,

249
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,800
but here this palette provides a way of editing the slideshow

250
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,500
from within the actual presentation,

251
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,800
rather than from the working notebook environment.

252
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,800
Choosing Side Notes

253
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,200
opens the Side Notes palette to show side notes,

254
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,300
which you could display on a different monitor

255
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,800
or on a separate tablet or other device.

256
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,200
You can also click within this palette

257
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,100
to move between slides.

258
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:34,000
Choosing Slide Outline opens the Slide Outline palette

259
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,400
that was shown earlier,

260
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:39,000
which provides yet another way of moving between slides.

261
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Going beyond a basic slideshow like this,

262
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
there's an unlimited range of possibilities

263
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,900
for what is displayed in a presentation

264
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,000
and for how that display is controlled.

265
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,600
To illustrate some of the possibilities,

266
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,900
consider this animation,

267
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,800
which is used for illustrating a topic

268
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,700
that comes up during this particular presentation.

269
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,700
During a presentation,

270
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,000
the presenter can control this animation

271
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,200
using the controls in the display.

272
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,400
There are, however, situations where it would be better

273
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,000
to have the controls somewhere else,

274
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,900
such as in a separate controller.

275
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,300
There are several ways to do that,

276
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,800
one of which is shown here.

277
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,400
This example shows a display in the presentation

278
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,900
that depends on a dynamically updated variable

279
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,000
and a button in a separate notebook

280
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,600
for controlling the value of that variable.

281
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,900
This allows the presentation

282
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,800
to be controlled by a separate controller,

283
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,300
which is useful in settings

284
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,600
where it is inconvenient for the presenter

285
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,100
to click on buttons in the display.

286
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,000
Wolfram Notebooks support a whole collection of features

287
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,500
for programmatic control of the display,

288
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,500
so it is possible to design presentations

289
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,000
with complex animations or sequences of images,

290
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,800
and to program all of that in advance

291
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,300
so that it can be shown during the presentation

292
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:44,650
with the click of a button on an off-screen controller.

293
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:46,800
That's the end of the examples for this section.

294
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,200
In the Wolfram documentation, you can find more information

295
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,000
by searching for presentations or slideshows,

296
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,750
and in particular from this page

297
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,650
on preparing and giving presentations,

298
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:58,800
which includes links to workflow guides like this one,

299
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,200
with step-by-step instructions

300
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,000
for the operations that came up in this section.
