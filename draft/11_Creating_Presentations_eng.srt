00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
这一章节的《 Wolfram 笔记本介绍》的内容

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,800
是使用笔记本进行演示

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,500
例如以幻灯片的形式显示笔记本

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,400
这里是一个典型的幻灯片的例子

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,900
它本质上只是一个笔记本

6
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:13,500
并且每次显示一张幻灯片

7
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,500
你可以通过点击显示屏右上角的这个按钮

8
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,400
(-)

9
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,700
待对照！！！然后在弹出的菜单中选择" "来结束幻灯片放映

10
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,800
这样会在工作格式下显示同一个笔记本

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,400
这个笔记本用来创建幻灯片

12
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,900
This working slideshow notebook

13
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,400
和其他的笔记本几乎一样

14
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,900
不过有两个基本的区别

15
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:33,200
一是两张幻灯片直接有空隙分隔

16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,000
二是是笔记本顶部会显示创作工具栏

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,900
！！不通顺：创作工具栏是一个停靠在顶端的单元
The authoring toolbar is a docked cell

18
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,800
带有常见操作的控件

19
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,400
例如插入新幻灯片页面、开始演示

20
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,600
The authoring toolbar and the Slide Break cells

21
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,900
and all of the other options that make this notebook

22
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,600
function as an environment for creating a slideshow

23
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,500
are set up in the stylesheet.

24
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,800
The stylesheet for this notebook

25
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,000
is chosen from the PresenterTools submenu

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,300
under the Format ► Stylesheet menu.

27
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,000
All of the stylesheets in the PresenterTools submenu

28
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
include all of the options for creating a slideshow.

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,450
In fact, any notebook can be made into a slideshow

30
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:09,600
by simply choosing one of the PresenterTools stylesheets

31
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,400
and inserting slide breaks.

32
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,100
For example, here is that same notebook,

33
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,200
but without any of the Slide Break cells

34
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,500
and with the normal Default stylesheet,

35
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:21,000
which is the item that is checked in the stylesheet submenu.

36
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,800
Further down this menu is the PresenterTools submenu,

37
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,800
and below that is another submenu called SlideShow.

38
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,450
The SlideShow submenu is included

39
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:30,300
to support an older slideshow system

40
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,300
that has been available

41
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,300
in Wolfram Notebooks for many years.

42
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,000
But this section is about the newer PresenterTools system,

43
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,100
which is an enhanced version of the older system.

44
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,800
To make this notebook into a slideshow,

45
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,300
we will choose one of the PresenterTools stylesheets.

46
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,250
A convenient way to insert slide breaks

47
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,300
is to first bring up the authoring toolbar,

48
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,900
which is made visible by changing

49
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,950
the screen environment to Slideshow Working,

50
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:55,300
using the Screen Environment submenu under the Format menu.

51
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,000
Clicking the Insert New Slide button

52
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
in the authoring toolbar opens a short popup menu

53
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,200
offering to insert a slide break with or without a background.

54
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,000
Either choice inserts the slide break,

55
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,800
which is marked by a new cell

56
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,000
with a cell style called slideshow navigation bar.

57
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,500
You can also create a new slide

58
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,800
by copying and pasting the Slide Break cell

59
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,400
from elsewhere in the notebook.

60
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,700
For example, we can select the Slide Break cell

61
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,800
and the Section cell below it,

62
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,750
and then copy that selection and paste those cells elsewhere

63
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,000
in the notebook to get a new slide.

64
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,200
This sort of editing is also a way of deleting slides

65
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,600
or deleting slide breaks.

66
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,000
For example, to delete the slide that was just added,

67
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
we can select the Slide Break cell

68
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,300
and the contents of the slide and delete that selection.

69
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,000
Another way of inserting slide breaks

70
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
throughout the notebook

71
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
is to click the Slide Break Defaults button

72
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,700
in the authoring toolbar,

73
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,000
which opens a dialog box

74
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,300
where you can choose slide breaks based on cell styles.

75
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,300
For example, choosing Section in this dialog box

76
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,800
and clicking the Set button inserts a slide break

77
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,500
before every Section cell in the notebook.

78
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,800
If the notebook is already organized into sections,

79
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,000
this is a fast way of turning the notebook into a slideshow.

80
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,750
Rather than converting a default notebook

81
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:05,825
into a slideshow,

82
00:03:05,825 --> 00:03:06,825
in many cases

83
00:03:06,825 --> 00:03:08,300
the easiest way to create a new slideshow

84
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:11,000
is to start by choosing New ► Presenter Notebook

85
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
from the File menu,

86
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
which brings up this dialog box

87
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,950
for choosing from the same set of PresenterTools stylesheets,

88
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:19,500
which are here referred to as themes.

89
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,600
From this dialog box you can also choose

90
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,500
from various default fonts and color schemes.

91
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,900
After making some choices,

92
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,400
click the Create button to get a slideshow template

93
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,500
with the chosen PresenterTools stylesheet

94
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,500
and the screen environment set to Slideshow Working

95
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,800
and the authoring toolbar at the top and several slides

96
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,900
with some generic content already filled in.

97
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,300
This notebook can then be edited much like any other notebook

98
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:44,500
to fill in the contents of the slideshow.

99
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,200
Several of the buttons in the authoring toolbar

100
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,500
are generic controls for fonts and styling

101
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,300
that could apply to any notebook.

102
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,250
For example, this button brings up a menu

103
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:53,600
for choosing cell style,

104
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,600
which are the same styles that can be chosen

105
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,200
from the Style submenu under the Format menu.

106
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,750
Next to the cell style menu

107
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,400
is an interesting button that can be used

108
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,900
to add font choices to all cells of the selected style.

109
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:05,900
For example,

110
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:09,000
after setting this text cell to use large, bold characters,

111
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,600
clicking that button has the effect

112
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,050
of applying those options to all of the text cells

113
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,300
in the notebook.

114
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,550
This worked by editing the private stylesheet

115
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:17,550
for this notebook.

116
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:18,550
For example,

117
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,500
choosing Edit Stylesheet from the Format menu

118
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,800
shows the private stylesheet for this notebook

119
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,500
with the new local style definitions

120
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,500
that specify large, bold characters for the text.

121
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,700
You could achieve the same effect

122
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,400
by editing the stylesheet directly,

123
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,400
so that button in the authoring toolbar

124
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,700
essentially provides

125
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,200
one-click editing of the stylesheet.

126
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,000
One button that is worth saying a few words about

127
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
is this button, which opens a popup menu

128
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,800
for making font sizes larger or smaller.

129
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,500
To describe what that menu does, it is helpful to first bring up

130
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,800
a feature of all PresenterTools stylesheets,

131
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,750
which is dynamic resizing of content

132
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,800
depending on the size of the window.

133
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,300
For example, if the size of this window is changed,

134
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,300
the font sizes change, and in fact the sizes of images

135
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,800
and almost all of the other content

136
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,300
within the notebook also changes based on the size of the window.

137
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,100
You could get the same effect in any notebook

138
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:07,800
by using scaled sizes for fonts and images and so on,

139
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,900
but unlike most other stylesheets, with PresenterTools stylesheets

140
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,000
all of the options settings for that resizing

141
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,500
are already part of the stylesheet.

142
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,700
Dynamic resizing like this

143
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,600
is helpful for the common situation

144
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,950
where you want to enlarge the window for presentation

145
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:23,800
or where the presentation is done on a different display system

146
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,300
where window sizes might be different.

147
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:29,300
Returning now to the specific issue of font sizes,

148
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:32,500
if font size is specified by selecting some text

149
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,100
and choosing a font size from the Size submenu

150
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,600
under the Format menu,

151
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,600
the size of that text remains constant

152
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,800
as the size of the window is changed,

153
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,800
since that size setting takes precedence

154
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,000
over the dynamic resizing system from the stylesheet.

155
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
The font size button

156
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,100
in the authoring toolbar works differently.

157
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:52,950
For example, selecting some text and then choosing a new size

158
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:55,300
from the popup menu in the authoring toolbar

159
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,400
causes the size of the selected text

160
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,900
to be scaled up or down by the chosen number of steps,

161
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,900
and the resized text does change size

162
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,800
based on the size of the window.

163
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,300
Similar issues also apply to images and to graphics.

164
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,000
For example, selecting this image

165
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,500
changes the authoring toolbar

166
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,400
to show a button for locking the current size of the image

167
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,300
or letting the size of the image change

168
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,000
with the size of the window.

169
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,700
Choosing Lock to current size

170
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,800
sets the image size option for that selection

171
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,300
to the current fixed value,

172
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,500
which results in an image that, like the text shown earlier,

173
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,000
remains at a fixed size

174
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
when the size of the window is changed.

175
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
So while dynamic resizing is the default,

176
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,400
you can get fixed sizes by specifying sizes

177
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,800
for individual selections.

178
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,500
Other buttons in the authoring toolbar

179
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,300
include the Start Presentation button,

180
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,800
which is the button to click to start the presentation,

181
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,500
which we will do in a moment.

182
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,900
The first button below the Start Presentation button

183
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,000
brings up a palette of buttons

184
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,200
showing the outline of the slideshow.

185
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,500
These buttons can be clicked

186
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,000
to navigate between slides in the notebook.

187
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,500
This palette also includes a refresh button

188
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,500
to update the palette if slides are added or removed.

189
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,300
The button next to that opens the Side Notes palette,

190
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,000
which provides a way of adding notes

191
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,300
that are intended for the presenter

192
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,400
and that will be shown in this palette,

193
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,000
but that are not displayed in the presentation.

194
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,500
To add a side note,

195
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,000
click the Add note to slide button,

196
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,100
which inserts a cell called a SideNote cell

197
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,000
into the slideshow notebook.

198
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,600
This cell can be edited just like any other cell.

199
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,800
Clicking the refresh button updates the Side Notes palette

200
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,000
with any new side notes.

201
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,300
Clicking this last button opens a popup menu.

202
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,100
Choosing Style Palette from that menu

203
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,400
opens a palette of buttons

204
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,500
like the buttons in the authoring toolbar.

205
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,300
Choosing Presentation Controls

206
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,500
opens a dialog box for customizing the computer keys

207
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,500
for navigating between slides.

208
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,200
Choosing Theme Options opens the same dialog box

209
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,500
that was used initially for choosing a stylesheet.

210
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,300
So if you wanted to change the stylesheet

211
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,800
from the stylesheet that was chosen initially,

212
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,100
you can do that here,

213
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,600
or equivalently, by choosing a different stylesheet

214
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,400
from the Stylesheet submenu.

215
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,300
For example, this changes the fonts

216
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,000
and the color scheme of the presentation

217
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
by changing the stylesheet.

218
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,400
To start the slideshow,

219
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,500
we can click the Start Presentation button.

220
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,000
At the end of the Start Presentation button

221
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,900
is a popup menu for other screen environments.

222
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,800
Scrolling Presentation gives a display

223
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,400
for scrolling through the slides

224
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,500
rather than clicking from slide to slide,

225
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,800
and Slideshow Presentation

226
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,100
switches the screen environment to Slideshow Presentation,

227
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,000
which removes the authoring toolbar

228
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
and the Slide Break cells and the SideNote cells.

229
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Clicking the main Start Presentation button

230
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,200
does all of that

231
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,500
and also switches to full-screen display.

232
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,900
After the presentation is started,

233
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,000
you can move between slides

234
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,900
using keys on the computer keyboard

235
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,900
or the corresponding keys on a separate controller.

236
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,400
Within the slideshow, there is a button

237
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,000
in the upper-right corner of the window

238
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
that can be clicked

239
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,800
to open a popup menu with other controls.

240
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,800
There are choices here for moving to the first slide

241
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,000
or to the next slide and so on.

242
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Choosing Toggle Navigation Bar adds on-screen controls

243
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
at the top of the window for moving between slides.

244
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,100
Choosing Toggle Style Tools opens the same palette

245
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,300
of style controls that was shown earlier.

246
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,000
In Slideshow Working screen environment,

247
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,650
this palette isn't usually needed since the same controls

248
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:10,800
are available in the authoring toolbar,

249
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,800
but here this palette provides a way of editing the slideshow

250
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,500
from within the actual presentation,

251
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,800
rather than from the working notebook environment.

252
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,800
Choosing Side Notes

253
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,200
opens the Side Notes palette to show side notes,

254
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,300
which you could display on a different monitor

255
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,800
or on a separate tablet or other device.

256
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,200
You can also click within this palette

257
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,100
to move between slides.

258
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:34,000
Choosing Slide Outline opens the Slide Outline palette

259
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,400
that was shown earlier,

260
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:39,000
which provides yet another way of moving between slides.

261
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Going beyond a basic slideshow like this,

262
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
there's an unlimited range of possibilities

263
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,900
for what is displayed in a presentation

264
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,000
and for how that display is controlled.

265
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,600
To illustrate some of the possibilities,

266
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,900
consider this animation,

267
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,800
which is used for illustrating a topic

268
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,700
that comes up during this particular presentation.

269
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,700
During a presentation,

270
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,000
the presenter can control this animation

271
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,200
using the controls in the display.

272
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,400
There are, however, situations where it would be better

273
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,000
to have the controls somewhere else,

274
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,900
such as in a separate controller.

275
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,300
There are several ways to do that,

276
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,800
one of which is shown here.

277
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,400
This example shows a display in the presentation

278
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,900
that depends on a dynamically updated variable

279
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,000
and a button in a separate notebook

280
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,600
for controlling the value of that variable.

281
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,900
This allows the presentation

282
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,800
to be controlled by a separate controller,

283
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,300
which is useful in settings

284
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,600
where it is inconvenient for the presenter

285
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,100
to click on buttons in the display.

286
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,000
Wolfram Notebooks support a whole collection of features

287
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,500
for programmatic control of the display,

288
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,500
so it is possible to design presentations

289
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,000
with complex animations or sequences of images,

290
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,800
and to program all of that in advance

291
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,300
so that it can be shown during the presentation

292
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:44,650
with the click of a button on an off-screen controller.

293
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:46,800
That's the end of the examples for this section.

294
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,200
In the Wolfram documentation, you can find more information

295
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,000
by searching for presentations or slideshows,

296
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,750
and in particular from this page

297
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,650
on preparing and giving presentations,

298
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:58,800
which includes links to workflow guides like this one,

299
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,200
with step-by-step instructions

300
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,000
for the operations that came up in this section.
