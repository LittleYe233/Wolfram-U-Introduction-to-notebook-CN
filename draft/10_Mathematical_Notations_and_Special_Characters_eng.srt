00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,600
这一章节的《Wolfram 笔记本介绍》

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,800
讲述了特殊字符、符号

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,000
和数学符号

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,500
本节大部分内容可以通过

5
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,000
思考多种基本的数学表述来说明

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
(-)

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,700
一种输入数学表述的方法是使用“面板” (palettes)

8
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,100
让我们从打开“数学助手”面板 (Basic Math Assistant palette) 开始

9
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,900
从“面板” (Palettes) 菜单下打开“数学助手” (Basic Math Assistant)

10
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:26,300
面板的每一部分都显示着一组按钮

11
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,300
用于向笔记本中输入符号

12
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:29,300
笔记本中同样也有键盘指令

13
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,000
用来输入符号

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,600
稍后我们将讲解键盘指令

15
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,800
我们先从面板开始入手

16
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,700
输入所示公式需要的按钮

17
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,000
are in the section labeled Typesetting.

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,650
！！！这句没补全；选择“”后  在第一个标签页下

19
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:42,600
就是输入数学符号

20
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,600
例如分数线和指数所需的按钮了

21
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,800
在第二个标签页下

22
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,200
是用于输入特殊符号和希腊字母的按钮

23
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,900
回到第一个标签页  我们可以从点击

24
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,500
标示定积分的按钮开始

25
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,300
这会向笔记本输入一个带有空框的模板

26
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:59,100
这些空框叫做“占位符”  用来输入符号中空缺的部分

27
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,900
积分下限

28
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,650
被着色的背景所高亮

29
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:04,950
以显示输入位置

30
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:07,600
在这个例子中  积分下限是 0

31
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,000
所以我们输入 0

32
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,900
再按下 TAB 按钮移动光标到下一个占位符处

33
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,200
也就是积分上限所在的位置

34
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,000
范例中的积分上限

35
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,300
是一个特殊符号

36
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,000
也就是数学中的无穷符号

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,100
为了输入这一符号  需要点击第二个标签页

38
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,600
来打开用于输入特殊字符和希腊字母的按键组

39
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,600
然后点击面板中标示无穷符号 (∞) 输入积分上界

40
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,300
(-)

41
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,750
接着按下 TAB 键到达下一个占位符处

42
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:35,000
在本例中是被积函数

43
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,200
被积函数的第一部分是一个指数式

44
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,100
指数符号在第一个标签页下

45
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,400
按下按钮输入指数的模板

46
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,900
(-)

47
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:46,000
接着回到第二页输入底数 <i>e</i>

48
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,900
按下 TAB 键到达下一个占位符处

49
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,500
这里是指数

50
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,900
现在我们输入指数 –2<i>x</i>.

51
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,300
在此时继续输入

52
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,200
会在指数上继续输入内容

53
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,000
但为了继续完成样例

54
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,400
我们需要从指数中离开

55
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,400
用于结束输入指数

56
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,000
and move to the enclosing expression 的快捷键

57
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,600
是 Ctrl + 空格

58
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,900
光标在指数上时

59
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,000
按下 Ctrl + 空格

60
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,800
并且完成这个积分式

61
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,200
你也可以用鼠标点击指数外侧

62
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,500
来使光标离开指数位置

63
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,500
(-)

64
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,950
现在按下 TAB 按键到达下一个占位符

65
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:23,000
再输入 <i>x</i> 完成这个输入

66
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
这是一个动态的输入

67
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,200
它也可以和其他输入一样被计算并且得到结果

68
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,500
(-)

69
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,500
这一输入的样式和原始样例不大相同

70
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,400
在排列和字符的形状上都有些许不同点

71
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,500
(-)

72
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,400
此处的不同是因为原始样例处于传统样式 (TraditionForm)

73
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,500
(-)

74
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,000
然而我们的输入是标准样式 (StandardForm)

75
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
(-)

76
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,300
标准样式 (StandardForm) 可以被转换为传统样式 (TraditionalForm)

77
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,000
通过选中输入单元  然后选择

78
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
“单元”菜单下的“转换成” ► “TraditionalForm ”

79
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,500
传统样式 (TraditionalForm) 看起来更像传统数学的写法

80
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,350
它们通常更加受欢迎

81
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:57,350
传统样式 (TraditionalForm) 不是默认格式的唯一原因

82
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:58,900
(-)

83
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:02,000
是转换传统数学格式到计算机输入

84
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,300
需要有点儿

85
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,500
复杂并且不规则的转换规则集

86
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,000
例如  在标准样式 (StandardForm) 下函数以方括号包住参数

87
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
(-)

88
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,200
但在传统样式 (TraditionalForm) 下

89
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,000
函数的参数被圆括号包裹

90
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,200
但是圆括号的这种用法有潜在的歧义

91
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,400
因为圆括号也可以用来表示

92
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,700
arithmetic grouping

93
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,000
电脑并不能总是猜对

94
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,400
圆括号在每种情境下分别表示什么

95
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,500
然而作为一个实际问题

96
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,650
转换传统样式 (TraditionalForm) 输入的规则

97
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:31,650
执行的非常完美

98
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:33,500
所以  如果你偏好传统样式 (TraditionalForm)

99
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,000
你完全有理由使用它

100
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,900
另外如果你只是用传统样式来显示而不是用来输入

101
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,000
它一点儿都没有问题

102
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,800
上述输入及所有的符号

103
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,900
也都可以使用键盘指令输入

104
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,650
将鼠标悬停在面板中符号对应的的按钮上是学习键盘命令的一种方式

105
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:51,500
(-)

106
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,000
例如  悬停鼠标于

107
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,500
面板中自然对数的底 <i>e</i> 按钮上

108
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,800
会显示一个提示框

109
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,600
其中显示了符号的名称

110
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,200
！！！需校对：这里是“指数<i>e</i>”

111
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,100
和相应的键盘指令 这里是 ESC + ee + ESC
译注：先按一下 ESC，输入 ee，再按一下 ESC，下同

112
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,650
在键盘上输入  ESC + ee + ESC

113
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:09,000
！！！需校对：会输入样例中出现的常数“自然对数的底”<i>e</i>

114
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,100
(-)

115
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,500
数学模板同样也有键盘指令

116
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,500
例如  , under the tab for typesetting forms,

117
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,000
在输入定积分的按钮上悬停鼠标

118
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,900
(-)

119
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:24,000
就会显示键盘指令 ESC + dintt + ESC

120
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,500
用键盘输入上述指令

121
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,000
就可以得到定积分模板

122
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,450
键盘指令的名字

123
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:32,000
在选取时就考虑了记忆它们的合理方法

124
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
例如  无穷符号的键盘指令

125
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
是 ESC + int + ESC

126
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,850
不定积分模板的键盘指令

127
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:42,200
是 ESC + dintt +ESC

128
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:46,500
这里的 d-i-n-t-t  是不定积分 (<u>d</u>efinite <u>in</u>tegral <u>t</u>empla<u>t</u>e) 的缩写

129
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,800
为了继续完成输入

130
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,300
我们需要输入积分下限

131
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,400
然后按下 TAB 按键

132
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,500
移动光标到积分上限

133
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,700
输入无穷符号的键盘指令

134
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,900
是 ESC + inf + ESC

135
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,800
接着按下 TAB 按键移动到被积函数

136
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,500
按下 ESC + ee + ESC 以输入 <i>e</i>

137
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,800
再按下 Ctrl + 6 输入指数模板

138
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,400
在一般的键盘上脱字符 “^” 位于按键 6 上

139
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,400
它在电脑上是用来表示指数的符号

140
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,400
(-)

141
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,000
所以记住 Ctrl 键和那个印有 “^” 的按键是记住快捷键 Ctrl + 6 的好方法

142
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,500
(-)

143
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,900
最后在指数中按下 TAB 按键

144
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,500
移动光标到最后一个占位符并完成输入

145
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,900
This input could have been entered in many different ways.

146
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,800
For example, to enter the exponential

147
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,400
rather than starting with the template,

148
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,500
we can start with the exponential <i>e</i> character,

149
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,900
select that character

150
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,200
and then click the button for the template.

151
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,100
This had the effect of inserting the exponential <i>e</i> character

152
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,800
in place of the filled black square

153
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,500
that is shown on the button.

154
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,800
Several of the buttons in this palette

155
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,000
have placeholders that are filled black squares

156
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
rather than empty black squares.

157
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,800
The filled black squares are selection placeholders,

158
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,300
which work just like the empty square placeholders

159
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,900
except that if something in the notebook is selected

160
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:57,700
when one of those buttons

161
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:01,300
with a filled black square selection placeholder is clicked,

162
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,200
then the selected expression gets inserted

163
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,500
in place of the selection placeholder.

164
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,650
For example, the definite integral example

165
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:08,650
could have been entered

166
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:11,500
by starting with the inner expression.

167
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,900
The button that was used earlier for entering

168
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,800
the definite integral template does not have

169
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,800
a filled black square selection placeholder,

170
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,050
but there is a similar button

171
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:21,200
in the Basic Commands section of the palette

172
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,500
that does have a selection placeholder.

173
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,750
To enter the input, select the expression

174
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,100
and click the button,

175
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,650
which inserts the selected expression

176
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:31,400
in place of the selection placeholder.

177
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,600
This template is also different

178
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,500
in that it has descriptive placeholders

179
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,500
that display as shaded boxes

180
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:40,100
with reminders about the purpose of each part of the input.

181
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,300
These descriptive placeholders

182
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,300
work just like the empty box placeholders

183
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:47,400
and can be filled in just as before to complete the input.

184
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,200
All of these notations and special characters

185
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,800
can be used in Text cells and in graphics

186
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,000
and almost anywhere else in the notebook.

187
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
For example, here is a Text cell

188
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,200
with some mathematical notations within the text.

189
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,800
This Text cell can be entered

190
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,000
using much the same process as was used for entering input.

191
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,500
Start with a Text cell and use either the palette

192
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:10,800
or keyboard commands to enter mathematical notations.

193
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,800
An important aspect of this Text cell

194
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,500
is that the formatted mathematics

195
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,800
is actually in a separate cell called an Inline cell.

196
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,500
Clicking within the formatted mathematics

197
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,500
changes the background color to highlight the Inline cell.

198
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,000
To leave the Inline cell and continue entering text,

199
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,600
you can either click beyond the Inline cell

200
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,400
or press CONTROL+0,

201
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,000
which is the keyboard command to end the Inline cell.

202
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,700
In that example, the Inline cell was created automatically

203
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,500
as soon as some notation other than text was entered,

204
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,750
but in general it is necessary

205
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,600
to first create a new Inline cell,

206
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,000
which you can do by choosing Start Inline Cell

207
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,700
from the Typesetting menu under the Insert menu,

208
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,400
and right below that is End Inline Cell,

209
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,800
which is the command that was used

210
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,000
to end an Inline cell.

211
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,650
The keyboard command for Start Inline Cell

212
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:55,650
is CONTROL+9

213
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:57,650
and the keyboard command for End Inline Cell

214
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:58,650
is CONTROL+0.

215
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:00,550
So to enter another Inline cell,

216
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:03,000
press CONTORL+9 to create the cell,

217
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
then enter the fraction,

218
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
press CONTROL+0 to end the inline cell

219
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,900
and return to the enclosing text cell

220
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,750
and complete the input.

221
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,600
These notations can also be used in graphics.

222
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,600
For example, this input uses the Epilog option

223
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,000
to add a formatted label to a plot.

224
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,400
The label is entered here just as it would be

225
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,650
in any other input.

226
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:24,000
Keyboard commands for special characters

227
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
are referred to as aliases.

228
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,800
Many common characters have aliases

229
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,500
and often several aliases.

230
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,000
For example, the tooltip for the Greek letter alpha

231
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,400
shows that the long name of the character

232
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,000
is the capitalized word Alpha,

233
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
which can be entered by typing backslash,

234
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,200
square bracket, followed by the long name,

235
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,650
and as soon as the closing square bracket is entered,

236
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:46,400
the display turns into the character.

237
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,900
Characters can also be entered using tech or SGML names.

238
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,500
For example, typing ESCAPE+BACKSLASH+alpha,

239
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,700
which is the tech name for this character,

240
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,000
and pressing the ESCAPE key a second time

241
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,500
gives the same alpha character.

242
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,500
The SGML name,

243
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,450
which comes up in HTML documents,

244
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:05,000
can be entered as ESCAPE, ampersand,

245
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,100
then the SGML name of the character,

246
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,700
which is also Alpha,

247
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,000
followed by a semicolon and then pressing

248
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,900
the ESCAPE key a second time to get the character.

249
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,150
So if you already know

250
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:17,150
character names from tech or from SGML,

251
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,400
you can use those names

252
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,300
to enter characters in Wolfram Notebooks.

253
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,300
There are many thousands of special characters.

254
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,800
At the bottom of each grid of characters

255
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,500
in the basic math assistant palette

256
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,900
is a button that opens the Special Characters palette,

257
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,700
which is the same palette that is opened

258
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:34,000
by choosing Special Character under the Insert menu.

259
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,400
If you see a character like this one

260
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,000
and would like to know how to enter it,

261
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,600
you can select the character

262
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,400
and choose Find Selected Function from the Help menu

263
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,000
to bring up the documentation page

264
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,300
for that character,

265
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,300
which for this character

266
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,000
shows the long name of the character,

267
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,700
which is DoubleLongRightArrow and the Unicode number

268
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,500
and the alias and some other information.

269
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,000
Not all characters have aliases

270
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,300
and some less common characters do not even have long names,

271
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,000
but it is essentially always possible

272
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,500
to enter a character as Unicode.

273
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,800
For example, backslash, colon, followed by the Unicode number

274
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,000
gives the double long right arrow character.

275
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,200
That's the end of the examples for this section.

276
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,800
You can find more information in the Wolfram documentation

277
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,300
in this tutorial on two-dimensional expression input.

278
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,000
This section covered the basic process

279
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
for entering mathematics and special characters,

280
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
but there are many details that can also be controlled

281
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
involving things like the size and alignment of characters

282
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,600
and ways to customize the formatting

283
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,000
and customize the handling of various inputs.

284
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,800
If your application requires that sort of control,

285
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,300
you can find more information in the section

286
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:40,000
on math typesetting options and tweaking

287
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
and in links from this guide page on defining custom notation.
