00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
This section of Introduction
to Wolfram Notebooks

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,000
is about formatting things
like tables and matrices

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,400
and bullet lists.

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,000
Starting with bullet lists,

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,400
one easy way to get a bullet
or itemized list

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,700
is to choose Item
from the Style submenu

7
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:15,200
under the Format menu,
to get an Item cell

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,600
and then enter
the contents of the cell.

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,500
Item cells have the property
that pressing the RETURN key

10
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,300
from within an Item cell
generates a new Item cell,

11
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,900
so items can be added
just by typing RETURN.

12
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,300
There is also
a keyboard shortcut

13
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:29,650
for creating an Item cell,

14
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:32,800
which is to type an asterisk
to create a new cell.

15
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,600
For example,
with the cell insertion bar

16
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,600
where it is now,

17
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,500
the input would, by default,
become an Input cell.

18
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,100
But if I type an asterisk
as the first character,

19
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,100
then the cell becomes
an Item cell.

20
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,500
So that is a way to enter
an itemized list

21
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,000
directly from the keyboard,
without using the menus.

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,700
Numbered lists can be created
by choosing ItemNumbered

23
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:55,200
from the Style submenu
and proceeding much as before.

24
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:59,700
The number is incremented
automatically for each new entry.

25
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,900
The number in those numbered
items is the cell dingbat.

26
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,100
A cell dingbat in general
is just a marker

27
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,000
on the left side of the cell.

28
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,400
The numbering, however, can
actually be inserted anywhere.

29
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,800
For example, to get
automatically numbered sections,

30
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:15,000
I can enter a section heading
and insert a number,

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,800
by positioning the entry point
where I want to put the number

32
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,500
and choosing Automatic Numbering
from the Insert menu,

33
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,500
which brings up a dialog box
that I can use to insert a number

34
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:28,000
that will be incremented
for each new section cell.

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,800
I can insert more
numbered sections

36
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,400
by making a copy of that cell
and pasting it

37
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,300
wherever I want
a new numbered section,

38
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,800
and the number will be
incremented automatically

39
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,000
for each section.

40
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,800
You can find more information
about automatic numbering

41
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,200
in the Wolfram documentation

42
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,500
in this tutorial
on automatic numbering

43
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,200
and in the documentation

44
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,400
for the Automatic Numbering
menu item.

45
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,000
Moving on now
to creating tables and matrices,

46
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,300
an easy way to get a matrix is
to choose the Table/Matrix item

47
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,900
under the Insert menu.

48
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,900
Choosing New from the submenu
brings up this dialog box,

49
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,800
where I can set various options

50
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,000
and choose the number of rows
and the number of columns.

51
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Here I will click the button
to give a matrix

52
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,600
and specify 3 rows and 3 columns

53
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,000
and then click the OK button

54
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
to get a 3-by-3 matrix
in the notebook.

55
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,300
The elements in that matrix

56
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,300
are empty boxes
called placeholders,

57
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,000
where I can enter
matrix elements.

58
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,700
I will use the mouse
to select the first placeholder

59
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,000
and enter a value,

60
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,300
then use the Tab key to move
to the next placeholder

61
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,000
and enter the next value,

62
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,500
then use the Tab key again

63
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,000
to move to the next placeholder
and enter the next value

64
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
and so on for the rest
of the matrix.

65
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,500
The Add Row and Add Column items
in the Table/Matrix submenu

66
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,700
can be used to add rows
and columns to this matrix.

67
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,000
To do that,
I will click on the matrix

68
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
to select where I want to enter
a row or a column

69
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
and then choose the Add Row
or Add Column menu items.

70
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,500
Those menu items
also have keyboard shortcuts.

71
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,600
CONTROL+RETURN
creates a new row

72
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,300
and CONTROL+COMMA
creates a new column,

73
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,600
and those keyboard shortcuts

74
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,800
actually can also be used
outside of a matrix

75
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,000
to create a new matrix.

76
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,600
For example,
if I press CONTROL+RETURN

77
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,800
in a place that isn't part
of a current matrix,

78
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,600
the effect is to generate a new
matrix with one placeholder

79
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,000
and add a row to that matrix,

80
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,800
which gives a matrix
with two rows and one column.

81
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,000
Additional rows and columns
can then be created

82
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,300
by pressing CONTROL+RETURN
to add rows

83
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:25,000
and CONTROL+COMMA
to add columns,

84
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,500
so it is possible to create
a matrix entirely

85
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,500
using keyboard commands,
without ever going to the menus.

86
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,800
The system for formatting
a matrix can also be used

87
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,000
to format a table
like this one.

88
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,600
Start by choosing Table/Matrix
from the Insert menu

89
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,000
and click New
to bring up the dialog box.

90
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
This time I will select
the Table button.

91
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,800
I also want lines
between the rows

92
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,600
and lines between the columns
and a frame around the table,

93
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,500
so I will check all
of those boxes

94
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,800
and click OK to get the table.

95
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,800
I could have specified
a 6x5 table in the dialog box,

96
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,300
but instead I will select
an element in the table

97
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:02,000
and use CONTROL+RETURN
and CONTROL+COMMA

98
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,500
to add rows and columns.

99
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,500
Several of the entries
in the desired table

100
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,300
span more than one row
or more than one column.

101
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,800
To get those spanning entries,

102
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,800
I will select the entries
that are to be merged

103
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,800
and choose Make Spanning
from the Table/Matrix menu

104
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,800
and repeat that process for

105
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,500
the other elements that are
combined in this table.

106
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,800
All that remains now

107
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,400
is to enter values
for the elements in the table,

108
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,800
but if I just start typing,

109
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,800
all of the inputs
are treated as variables

110
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,500
or as other
Wolfram Language commands,

111
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,800
which happens because
this is still an Input cell

112
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,450
and input into an Input cell
is treated by default

113
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:41,000
as Wolfram Language commands.

114
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Sometimes that is fine,

115
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,300
but since much of this table
is plain text,

116
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:47,000
it might be better
to have text be the default.

117
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,100
One way to make that happen

118
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:52,300
is to change the style
of this cell from Input to Text,

119
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,600
and as long as I am changing
the styles of things,

120
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,000
I will also change the font
using the Show Fonts dialog box.

121
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Now proceed with filling in
the entries in the table.

122
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,700
It is worth noting
that this is still a live table

123
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,800
that could have been generated
or filled in automatically,

124
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,000
and the table
and parts of the table

125
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,500
can be used as data
in other computations.

126
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,500
For example, I can copy
some desired part of the table

127
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,000
and paste that
into the Total function

128
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,800
to get the sum of the amounts
in that part of the table.

129
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,050
There is much more
that can be done

130
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:25,400
with the formatting of tables,

131
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,500
some of which is introduced
in the next section,

132
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,000
and you can also find

133
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,100
more information
in the Wolfram Documentation,

134
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:34,500
starting with this short tutorial
on entering tables and matrices

135
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,200
using the Table/Matrix menu item.

136
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,500
And you can also follow
links to this guide

137
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,000
to all of the functions
and options

138
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
related to grids and tables.
