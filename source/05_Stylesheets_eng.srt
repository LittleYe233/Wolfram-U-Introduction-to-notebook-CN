00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,300
This section of Introduction
to Wolfram Notebooks

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:04,500
is about customizing the style
of a notebook

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,600
by editing stylesheets.

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,300
The stylesheet is where all
of the cell styles

5
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,600
and things like indentation
and font sizes

6
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,300
and background colors and so on

7
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,400
are specified for cells
and for the notebook.

8
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,000
Every notebook has a stylesheet.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,500
The stylesheet can be chosen
from the Stylesheet submenu

10
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,000
under the Format menu.

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,900
This notebook was created
by just selecting new notebook

12
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:26,500
from the File menu
without specifying a stylesheet,

13
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,000
so the notebook was assigned
a stylesheet called Default,

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,900
which is the item
that is checked in this menu,

15
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,400
but there are lots of other
stylesheets to choose from.

16
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,000
For example, this chooses
the Sky stylesheet

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
from the PresenterTools submenu.

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,900
PresenterTools styles are used

19
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,500
for showing the notebook
as a slideshow,

20
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,000
as will be discussed
in a later section.

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,400
You can also select
Stylesheet Chooser

22
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,450
from the Style menu,

23
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:52,500
which opens this palette
for selecting a stylesheet.

24
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,500
The lower part of each item
in this display

25
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,700
is used to apply that style
to an existing notebook

26
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,600
and the upper part
creates a new notebook.

27
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,000
For example,
here I will click the upper part

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
of the entry
for a StandardReport style,

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
which gives a notebook that uses
the StandardReport stylesheet,

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,100
and in addition, that notebook
is already filled in

31
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,000
with examples
of all of the cell styles

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,400
that are defined
within that stylesheet,

33
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,500
which is a nice way
of getting an overview

34
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,700
of what the available
cell styles look like.

35
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,500
Even with lots
of possible stylesheets

36
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,700
and cell styles to choose from,

37
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,800
there are still situations where
it is useful to customize things,

38
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,600
which you can do
by editing the stylesheet.

39
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,300
To show an example
of how that can work,

40
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,400
I will return this notebook
to the default stylesheet

41
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,400
and choose Edit Stylesheet
from the Format menu.

42
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,700
The stylesheet that comes up
is not the default stylesheet,

43
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,400
but rather a private stylesheet
that is specific to this notebook.

44
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,000
This private stylesheet
can be used

45
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,500
to specify option settings

46
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,300
to apply in preference
to the settings

47
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,700
in the actual
default stylesheet.

48
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,400
For example,
to change the styles

49
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,500
for all of the text cells
in the notebook,

50
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,300
I will start by choosing Text
from the Choose a style menu,

51
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,700
which generates here
a special type of cell

52
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,200
that is mostly only used
in stylesheets.

53
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,300
The other items at the top
of this window

54
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,300
are the Enter a style name box,

55
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:10,400
which can be used to introduce
a new cell style

56
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,800
and the Install Stylesheet button,

57
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,200
which is used to add
a whole new stylesheet

58
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,800
that can be used
by other notebooks.

59
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,100
Any option settings that I add

60
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,000
for this new cell
in the stylesheet

61
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,800
will apply to all of
the text cells in the notebook.

62
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,500
For example,
here I will select this cell

63
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,700
and use items
under the Format menu

64
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:31,000
to set the background color
to light orange

65
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,500
and set an italic font.

66
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,800
Choosing Show Expression
from the cell menu

67
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,800
shows the underlying
cell expression,

68
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,300
with the new settings
for the background option

69
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,200
and the font slant option.

70
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,300
What makes this cell special
is that the content of the cell

71
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,800
is this style data expression.

72
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,300
The stylesheet itself
is a notebook

73
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,800
and in general a stylesheet
is just a notebook

74
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,900
where all of the cells are
these special style data cells.

75
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,400
Returning to
the original notebook

76
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,500
shows that this change
in the stylesheet

77
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,300
had the effect of changing
the background color

78
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,700
and the font slant

79
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,000
for all of the text cells
in the notebook.

80
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,900
It is still possible to override
the styles in the stylesheet

81
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:12,000
by making changes directly
to selections in a notebook.

82
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
For example,
if I don't want the italic font

83
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,300
for some part of the text,

84
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:19,000
I can select that text
and specify a different font.

85
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,400
When a style is specified
in several different places

86
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,000
like the italic font
in this text cell,

87
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
the general principle

88
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,600
is that styles that are set
for a specific selection

89
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,700
take precedence over settings
in a stylesheet.

90
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,400
That general principle
is also sometimes described

91
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,000
using the notion of inheritance.

92
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,100
We could say, for example,

93
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:39,200
that any style not explicitly
specified in the notebook

94
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,000
is inherited from
the stylesheet.

95
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,500
There is also a principle of
inheritance for the stylesheets,

96
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,500
since most notebooks
actually use

97
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,000
a sequence of stylesheets.

98
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,500
For example, returning to
the private stylesheet,

99
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,800
at the top of the stylesheet
is a cell that says

100
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:57,000
that styles here are inherited
from the default stylesheet.

101
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,500
Clicking on the hyperlink
in that cell

102
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,500
brings up the actual
default stylesheet,

103
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,800
which includes specifications
not just for text cells,

104
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,700
but for all of the cell styles
within this stylesheet.

105
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,000
The default stylesheet
also includes a cell at the top,

106
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,600
noting that this stylesheet
inherits styles

107
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,000
from another stylesheet
called Core,

108
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,800
which is the end
of the sequence.

109
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,300
Any style not specified
in one of these stylesheets

110
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,500
just uses a global value.

111
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,500
Inheritance for this set
of stylesheets

112
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,300
means that each stylesheet
inherits styles

113
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,000
from the stylesheet above it.

114
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,800
Usually the only stylesheet to
edit is the private stylesheet

115
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,000
for the notebook,

116
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,500
but it is often useful to see

117
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,650
what is in one
of the other stylesheets.

118
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:40,300
For example, one of the styles
in this stylesheet is Item style,

119
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,500
which can be used
for creating bullet lists

120
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,500
like this one,

121
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,400
but suppose that I want
to add a new style

122
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,500
that works just like Item style
except that the marker,

123
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,500
the cell dingbat for each cell,
is a checkmark

124
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,200
rather than a filled square

125
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,800
and the text is shown
in bold letters.

126
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,800
If I do that by going
to the private stylesheet

127
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,000
and choosing Item style,

128
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,800
I will be modifying
the default Item style,

129
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,400
but here I want to leave
the default Item style alone

130
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,000
and instead create
a new cell style,

131
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,500
which I will do by going through
the default stylesheet

132
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,300
and navigating to the cell
in this stylesheet

133
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,000
that describes Item cells,

134
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,500
where I will select
the cell bracket for that cell

135
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:21,000
to select the entire cell,
then copy the cell

136
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,400
and return to
the private stylesheet

137
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,400
for this notebook

138
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,500
and paste that cell
into the private stylesheet.

139
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,800
The difference between this cell
and the one above it

140
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,000
can be seen by showing
the cell expressions.

141
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,400
The second cell here,
which is the one that

142
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,400
I just copied from
the default stylesheet,

143
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,000
includes all of the option
settings for Item cells.

144
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,500
So even when I change
the name of the cell,

145
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,800
which will have the effect
of creating a new cell style,

146
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,550
the new cell style
will still behave

147
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:48,000
exactly like an Item cell.

148
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
The default CellDingbat
is the FilledSmallSquare,

149
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,800
which I will change now
to the Checkmark character.

150
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,000
I will also change the value
of the MenuSortingValue option

151
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,300
to a smaller number.

152
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,700
This isn't a critical change,
but it will have the effect

153
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,900
of moving the new cell style
to the top of the style menu,

154
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,000
where it will be easier to find.

155
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,500
There are several
other options here,

156
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,000
which won't be explored here,

157
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,800
except to note that one good way
to learn about options

158
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,500
is to find a cell style

159
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,800
and then look in the stylesheet
to see the options that were used

160
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,900
to set up that style.

161
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,600
I could change the font
to a bold font

162
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,000
by typing in the option here,

163
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,900
but I will instead do that
by reformatting the cell

164
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,000
and choosing Bold

165
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
from the Face item
under the Format menu.

166
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,500
Now return to
the original notebook

167
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,600
and add a cell

168
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,900
by choosing the new
CheckmarkItem style

169
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,800
from the Style menu,

170
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,900
which adds a new cell
that behaves like an item cell

171
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:46,500
except for the checkmark
cell dingbat and the bold font.

172
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,000
Before concluding the subject
of stylesheets,

173
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,800
many stylesheets support
variations that can be selected

174
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,400
by specifying an option
called Environment.

175
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,800
For example,
the current environment

176
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,300
for displaying this notebook
on the computer screen

177
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,500
is called Working environment,

178
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,000
which we can see
because Working is checked

179
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,500
in the Screen Environment submenu
under the Format menu.

180
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,800
If the screen environment
is changed to Printout,

181
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,000
the styles used in the notebook
change to styles

182
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
that are more appropriate
for printing.

183
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
In this example,
switching to Printout environment

184
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,200
changes the magnification
and the cell margins

185
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:21,000
and limits the page width
to the width of printing paper.

186
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,700
The different environments could,
in principle,

187
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,000
give cells with completely
different sets of options

188
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,500
and completely different styles,

189
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,700
but environments
are more typically used

190
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:31,000
to introduce small variations
on a general theme,

191
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,500
like optimizing a notebook
for printing

192
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:37,500
or optimizing a notebook
for a slide presentation.

193
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,300
There is really an enormous range
of other things

194
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,500
that can be done like this
to customize notebook styles.

195
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,500
You can find more information
about stylesheets

196
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,300
in the Wolfram Documentation

197
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:50,000
by navigating to this tutorial
on working with stylesheets

198
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
and a good reference

199
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
on the general structure
of Wolfram notebooks

200
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
is this section on notebooks
as Wolfram Language expressions.
