00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
This section of Introduction
to Wolfram Notebooks

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,500
is about making notebooks
into interactive documents

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,500
and more specifically
about setting up tools,

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,100
like the buttons
in this first example

5
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,300
for navigating through data
or linking to other documents,

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,800
and features, like the sliders
in this second example

7
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,400
that provide interactive controls
for running programs

8
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,500
and doing calculations
for within a notebook.

9
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,300
Probably the most common
interactive feature

10
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,300
of modern documents
is a simple hyperlink,

11
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,800
which is typically a link
to another document.

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,800
For example, here is a notebook
with gross domestic product

13
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:34,000
or GDP data for a group of
seven countries called the G7.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,700
In this notebook
G7 is a hyperlink,

15
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,000
which has been set up
so that clicking that link

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
brings up a webpage.

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,500
Hyperlinks can be created
using the Hyperlink button

18
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,900
from the Insert menu.

19
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:48,500
For example, to create
a hyperlink for the term GDP,

20
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,500
select GDP in the notebook,

21
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,500
then choose Hyperlink
from the Insert menu,

22
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,000
which brings up a dialog box

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,800
where I can enter
the destination of the link.

24
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,600
For this example, I will enter
a web address and click OK,

25
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,900
and after that
clicking GDP in the notebook

26
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,500
opens that webpage.

27
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,500
Hyperlinks are a common way

28
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,700
of organizing sets
of related documents

29
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,000
so that users of the documents
can follow hyperlinks

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,100
to the information
that they want to see.

31
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,400
For example, this notebook
is arranged in sections.

32
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,600
So to see information
on one of the countries,

33
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,500
I can scroll through the notebook
and open a section,

34
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,000
but the information
in each section

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,200
could also have been organized

36
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,400
with a separate notebook
for each section,

37
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,800
like the notebook shown here

38
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,000
and linked to the original
notebook using hyperlinks.

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,300
To create one
of those hyperlinks,

40
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,000
I will start in
the original notebook,

41
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,800
select the name of a country,

42
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,900
open the hyperlink dialog box

43
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,300
and click the Browse button
to open the file browser,

44
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:43,000
where I will choose a notebook
as the destination of the link.

45
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,700
Returning to
the original notebook,

46
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,000
the selected text
is now a hyperlink

47
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,900
that I can click
to open the other notebook.

48
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,300
Organizing information into
a set of hyperlinked notebooks

49
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,000
is especially useful
in more complex projects,

50
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
where documents might come
from different sources

51
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
or be created
by different people.

52
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,300
This hyperlink will only work
on a computer that

53
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,200
also has all
of the linked notebooks,

54
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,400
but the linked notebook could
also have been saved in the cloud

55
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,300
so that the hyperlink would work
on any computer

56
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,000
that is connected to the cloud.

57
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,300
For example,
here is another notebook

58
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,400
where I will choose
Publish to Cloud

59
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,800
to make the notebook
available in the cloud.

60
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,900
Then copy the URL
for use in the hyperlink

61
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:24,800
and create a hyperlink as before,
using the hyperlink dialog box.

62
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,000
Clicking that hyperlink

63
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,400
opens the saved notebook
in a web browser.

64
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,000
So that is a way
of setting up linked documents

65
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,400
that will work on any computer
that is connected to the cloud.

66
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,400
You can also use hyperlinks
to navigate within a notebook.

67
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,600
Hyperlinks within a notebook

68
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,100
work primarily by linking
to tagged cells.

69
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,800
To add a tag for a cell,
I can select the cell

70
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,800
and choose Add/Remove Cell Tags

71
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,500
from the Cell Tag submenu
under the Cell menu,

72
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,000
which brings up this dialog box
where I can enter a tag.

73
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,200
After entering the tag,

74
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,800
click the Add button
to add that tag,

75
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,000
and then set up
the hyperlink as before

76
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,800
using the hyperlink dialog box.

77
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,900
In the dialog box,
I will click the button

78
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,300
to use cells with the selected
tag as the destination.

79
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:11,100
Choose a tag and click OK
to create the hyperlink.

80
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,100
Clicking that hyperlink

81
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:16,000
jumps to the tagged cell
within this notebook.

82
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Another way
of setting up navigation

83
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,500
through the information
in a notebook

84
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,600
is with tools called views.

85
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,000
The basic idea is illustrated
by this example,

86
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,900
which shows a function
called TabView

87
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:29,500
that provides a row of buttons
for displaying different images.

88
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,000
The same system can also be used

89
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,200
to display the information
in this notebook.

90
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,800
For example,
here is a TabView input

91
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,600
that gives a display
with a row of buttons,

92
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,500
that can be clicked to
display data for each country.

93
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,200
There are several other functions
like the TabView function.

94
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,300
For example, this shows
a function called MenuView

95
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:50,800
that gives a menu
instead of a row of buttons.

96
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,300
Views can also be nested.

97
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,600
For example,
this shows a TabView

98
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,800
in which each displayed
expression is another tab view,

99
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,000
which is used here
for selecting a pair of countries

100
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,600
to include in the plot.

101
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,600
The best way of setting up

102
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,500
interactive navigation
through a document

103
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,000
depends, of course,
on what is in the document

104
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,700
and on who will be using it,

105
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,900
but all of these functions
have lots of options

106
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,000
and in the documentation
there are good tutorials

107
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,100
and lots of examples for learning
about the possibilities.

108
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,400
So far the examples
have mostly involved navigating

109
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,100
through a fixed set
of information,

110
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,500
but notebooks can also include
buttons and sliders

111
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,900
and other controls
for controlling programs

112
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,600
and doing calculations.

113
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,500
One tool for setting up
controls like that

114
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,000
is the Manipulate function.

115
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,400
Here is a simple Manipulate input
that gives a result with a slider

116
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,100
for adjusting the frequency
of a sine wave in a plot.

117
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,100
Here is the example
that was shown earlier.

118
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,000
This example is
a little more complicated,

119
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
but the basic idea is the same.

120
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
The first argument in Manipulate
gives the calculation to do

121
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,900
and the result to display

122
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:53,000
and the other arguments
specify the controls.

123
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
The calculation in this example
involves plotting

124
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,400
a numerical solution
of a differential equation,

125
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,000
and there are two sliders
for adjusting parameters

126
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,800
in the differential equation.

127
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,000
The sliders in that result
use a general system

128
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
for dynamically
updating calculations

129
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,800
whenever there is a change
in a parameter

130
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,000
that is used in that calculation.

131
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,200
Normally if a parameter
is used in a calculation,

132
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,600
such as the parameter <i>x</i>
in this plot,

133
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,400
the calculation
does not get redone

134
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,500
if the parameter is changed.

135
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,500
This plot, for example,
does not get regenerated

136
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,000
if I change the value of <i>x</i>.

137
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,400
To get a result that will be
dynamically updated,

138
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,200
I can enclose the result
in Dynamic.

139
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,650
Unlike the previous output,

140
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:34,300
this plot does change whenever
the value of <i>x</i> is changed.

141
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,800
One way of changing the value
of <i>x</i> is with a slider.

142
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,000
For example,
this input gives a slider

143
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
for setting the value of <i>x</i>
to a number between 0 and 10.

144
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,500
The Dynamic function
is used in the slider input

145
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:49,000
to indicate that changes
should cause automatic updating.

146
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
The result is a slider
that controls the plot.

147
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Wolfram Notebooks support
a variety of controls

148
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
other than sliders.

149
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,800
For example, here is a control
called an Animator

150
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,800
for continuously updating
the value of a parameter.

151
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,000
Here is another control
called a RadioButtonBar

152
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
that gives a row of buttons
for setting the value of <i>x</I>.

153
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,700
Another common
interactive control is a menu.

154
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:15,800
This input gives a pop-up menu
for setting the value of <i>x</i>.

155
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,000
Interactive features like these

156
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,900
can be useful
for illustrating concepts

157
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,800
or to allow someone
using the document

158
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,500
to do their own calculations.

159
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,600
For example,
this shows a modified version

160
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,300
of the earlier
Manipulate example,

161
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,300
this time including

162
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,500
an animation of a corresponding
mechanical system.

163
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,000
Interactive illustrations like
this are often quite helpful

164
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,200
for explaining
complicated topics.

165
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,500
The programming for this example

166
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,700
has been hidden
by closing the cell group.

167
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,400
I can double-click
on the cell bracket

168
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,500
to open the cell group

169
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,000
and show the input
that produced this result.

170
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,450
Most of the programming
is associated

171
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:49,000
with constructing
the images in the display.

172
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,300
The controls are specified

173
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,000
in just a few lines
of code at the end.

174
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
This last specification,
for example,

175
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,700
is the code that creates
this control, called a Trigger,

176
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:00,500
that initiates the animation.

177
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,000
These controls also work
in the cloud.

178
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,900
For example, this first input

179
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,800
generates a list
of the components

180
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,450
of the Dow Jones
Industrial Average

181
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:09,500
and after that,
here is a Manipulate

182
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:13,000
for plotting closing prices
of those components.

183
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,150
The control in this result

184
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:18,500
is a menu for choosing
the component to plot.

185
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,000
Rather than choosing
Publish to Cloud

186
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,550
from the File menu
to publish this entire notebook,

187
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:25,000
this time I will use
the CloudPublish function

188
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,800
to publish
just the Manipulate output.

189
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,000
The result is a link that
I could send to other people

190
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,300
or that here,
I will enter into a web browser

191
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:36,000
to show a notebook with that
same interactive display.

192
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,800
This result is similar
in appearance

193
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,400
to the MenuView example
shown earlier,

194
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,200
but making a choice
in this result

195
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,900
causes a new plot to be generated
using current data

196
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,500
rather than selecting
from pre-existing plots.

197
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,800
So this is a good approach
for sharing documents

198
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,800
with information
that might change.

199
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,000
That's the end of the examples
for the section.

200
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,100
You can find more information
on View functions,

201
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,900
like TabView and MenuView,

202
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,400
in the Wolfram documentation
by searching for views

203
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,500
and navigating to this page
on view functions.

204
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,900
For information on Manipulate,
a good place to start

205
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,500
is the documentation
for the Manipulate function.

206
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,000
There are also several tutorials
on Manipulate

207
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
and on controls in general,

208
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,100
and this guide page
on control objects

209
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:19,700
lists all of the various controls
like the sliders and popup menus

210
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,000
and other controls
that came up in this section.
