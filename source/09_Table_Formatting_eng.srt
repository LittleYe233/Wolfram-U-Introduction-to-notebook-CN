00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
This section of Introduction
to Wolfram Notebooks

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,400
describes a more precise tools
for formatting tables,

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,000
like the table shown here,

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,900
and is specifically about options
for setting up details,

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,500
like the horizontal divider

6
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,000
and the rows
with alternating backgrounds,

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,900
and tools for controlling
the appearance

8
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,500
of individual items in a table.

9
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,900
Starting with the first example,

10
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:22,900
here is an input that generates
a template for that table.

11
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,600
Evaluating this input
gives a result in an Output cell,

12
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,650
which I will convert
to a Text cell,

13
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:31,000
since most of the entries
in that table are plain text.

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The input uses the Grid function.

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,700
The first argument
of the Grid function

16
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,500
is the actual array
of table entries

17
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,500
that gives the headings
and an array of placeholders,

18
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,100
and there are six options.

19
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,000
The Background option
sets up the alternating

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
white and gray backgrounds
for the rows.

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,750
If I click inside the table

22
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,000
and use CONTROL+RETURN
to add more rows,

23
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,700
the alternating backgrounds
continue for the new rows.

24
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,200
The Alignment option specifies

25
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,000
the horizontal alignment
of entries within each column

26
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,700
and vertical alignment
within each row.

27
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,700
The Dividers option
draws the lines between the rows.

28
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:05,000
This is where
the thick horizontal divider

29
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,500
below the heading is specified.

30
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,600
The BaseStyle option

31
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,900
specifies the font to use
for entries in the table.

32
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,450
And finally, the ItemSize option

33
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:16,400
specifies the space
to allow for each column,

34
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,300
and the Spacings option
specifies space between columns.

35
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:23,000
There are lots of details
that these options control,

36
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,800
but the basic ideas
are fairly simple

37
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,500
and several of these options
use similar designs

38
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,300
that can be illustrated
by considering their effect

39
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,600
on a generic table.

40
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,150
Here is a table
with placeholder entries

41
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:35,600
and with Frame set to All

42
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,000
to make it easier
to see the rows and the columns.

43
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,500
Starting with
the Background option,

44
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,100
the Background option
can be set to a single color,

45
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,500
to set the background
for the entire grid,

46
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,300
but the general form
of the Background option

47
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,000
is a list with three elements

48
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
where the first element

49
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
specifies the background
for columns,

50
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,900
the second element
specifies the background for rows

51
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,900
and the third element
can be used to specify

52
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:00,000
the background for individual
elements in the table.

53
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,100
For example,
entering Red, Green, Blue

54
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,100
in the first element

55
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:07,750
causes the first three columns
to be red, green and blue.

56
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:08,850
Enclosing colors in a list

57
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:12,000
causes those colors
to be repeated across the table.

58
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,800
For example, this gives red
for the first column

59
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,900
and repeated green
and blue columns

60
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,000
for the rest of the table.

61
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,700
The same structure
applies to rows.

62
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,700
For example,

63
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,500
if that same color specification
is the second element

64
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,300
in the value
of the Background option,

65
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:29,000
the result is a table
where the first row is red

66
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,200
and the remaining rows alternate
between green and blue.

67
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,550
The third element in the value
of the Background option

68
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:38,000
can be used for specifying
the background color

69
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
of individual entries
in the table.

70
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,500
For example, this specifies

71
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,000
that the seventh element
in the fourth row

72
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
should have
an orange background.

73
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,500
Similar principles apply
to the Dividers option

74
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,500
and to the Alignment option
and to all of the options

75
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,800
that control specific
rows and columns.

76
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,900
For example, this shows a value
for the Dividers option

77
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,000
that gives a column divider
every third column

78
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,500
and a row divider
above the second row.

79
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,900
As with the Background option,

80
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,000
the value of the Dividers option
is a list.

81
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,200
The first element of that list
specifies column dividers

82
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,600
and the second element
specifies row dividers.

83
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,300
The dividers
can also have styles.

84
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,000
For example, this specifies
that the column dividers

85
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,800
should be repeated
thick lines and light gray lines,

86
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,700
and that the horizontal divider
below the top row

87
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,000
should be a thick red line.

88
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,800
With those general
principles in mind,

89
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,600
here again is the first example,

90
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,200
where I will go ahead and fill in
some values in the table.

91
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,600
This value
of the Background option

92
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,600
gives the alternating

93
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,600
white and light gray background
for the rows.

94
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,000
The Alignment option specifies

95
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,200
that items in the first column
should be centered horizontally.

96
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,400
The second column
should be aligned on the right,

97
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,000
as is typically done
for columns of numbers

98
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,600
and items in the third column
are aligned on the left.

99
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,150
This value of the Dividers option

100
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,500
gives the thick line
below the top row

101
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,600
and the light gray dividers
for all of the rows after that.

102
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,700
The light gray divider
becomes part of the background

103
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,750
for all of the rows
except the last one,

104
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,200
where the divider shows up

105
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,500
as a light grey line
at the bottom of the table.

106
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,950
The BaseStyle option
specifies the default font

107
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:12,500
to use for all of the items
in the table.

108
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,000
The ItemSize option here

109
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,200
specifies the width
of each column.

110
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,800
The first two columns
are given as scaled amounts,

111
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,250
which means that they are scaled
to a fraction

112
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,800
of the formatting width,

113
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,600
which is related to the width
of the window.

114
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,400
So the width
of the columns changes

115
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,700
with the width of the display,

116
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,200
which can be desirable

117
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,800
if the table might be displayed
in different windows.

118
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,800
Finally, this value
of the Spacings option

119
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,400
adds some space
between the last two columns.

120
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,000
A good way to learn
what these options do

121
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,900
is to try different values
for the options

122
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,800
and observe the effect
on the table.

123
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,350
For example, here is a simple
Manipulate program

124
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,400
that gives a control

125
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,000
for adjusting the space
between the last two columns.

126
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,650
Rather than using options
for the Grid function,

127
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:56,000
a separate strategy
for specifying styles

128
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,900
is to use Item expressions
as elements in the table

129
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:02,200
and to specify options
within each Item expression.

130
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,300
For example, rather than using
the Background option

131
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,800
to specify the background color

132
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,000
of a particular entry
in the table,

133
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,450
another way to get
the same effect

134
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:12,500
is to make that one element
into an Item expression

135
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,500
and to include
the Background option

136
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,300
in that Item expression.

137
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:20,300
A related feature
is using the special symbols

138
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:23,800
SpanFromLeft, SpanFromAbove
and SpanFromBoth

139
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,500
to get table entries that span
more than one row

140
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,100
or more than one column.

141
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:31,500
For example, here is
a small table of placeholders.

142
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,000
Replacing one
of those placeholders

143
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
with the special symbol
SpanFromLeft

144
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,800
causes that entry in the table

145
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,400
to be merged
with the entry to the left.

146
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,450
There are also symbols
called SpanFromAbove

147
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:42,600
and SpanFromBoth

148
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:47,200
that can be used to merge entries
vertically or in both directions.

149
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,300
The affect actually ends up
being the same

150
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,400
as selecting items to be merged

151
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:56,000
and choosing Make Spanning
from the Table/Matrix submenu.

152
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,800
As a final example which uses
several of these tools,

153
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,900
here is the second
of the two tables

154
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,400
that were shown earlier

155
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,400
together with an input
to generate that table.

156
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,400
This input again

157
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,500
uses the Grid function
with several options.

158
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,050
The ItemSize option
specifies columns

159
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:12,100
with a width of three,

160
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,500
which means
three units called ems.

161
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,800
An em is a unit

162
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,800
equal to the point size
of the current font.

163
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,300
If the ItemSize option
is omitted,

164
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:24,000
then the columns are adjusted
to the width of the widest item

165
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
in the column,

166
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,500
which here gives a table
with columns

167
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,900
that seem a bit too narrow,

168
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,650
so the ItemSize option
is included

169
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:32,900
to give a table
that is not quite so cramped.

170
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,500
This value of the Frame option
draws the divider lines

171
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,500
and the frame around the table.

172
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,000
This value of the Alignment option
specifies that

173
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
items should be centered
both vertically and horizontally

174
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
and the Background option

175
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,800
specifies a light gray background
for the top row

176
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,000
and alternating orange

177
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
and light blue background,
for the remaining rows.

178
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,500
Background is used in this table

179
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:56,300
as a color code for the T
and F entries in the table.

180
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,600
The Background option
happens in this example

181
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,400
to give the correct color
for all of the entries,

182
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,400
except for one

183
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,800
where the background is specified
in an Item expression.

184
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,000
Without that Item expression,

185
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,650
the color for that item
would be light blue,

186
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:12,500
which doesn't follow
the intended color code.

187
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:16,000
This table also includes
two SpanFromAbove entries,

188
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,800
which are there to generate
the two items in the first column

189
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,000
that span more than one row.

190
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
That's the end of the examples
for this section.

191
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,500
A good source
for additional information

192
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,800
is the documentation
for the Grid function

193
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,600
and related functions,

194
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,800
and especially this tutorial
on grids, rows and columns.

195
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,400
And it is of course
almost always useful

196
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,300
to just construct a generic table

197
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,000
and try these things out
for yourself.
