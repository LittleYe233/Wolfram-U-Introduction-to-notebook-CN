00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,600
This section of Introduction
to Wolfram Notebooks

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,800
is about notations
like special characters

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,000
and notations
used in mathematics.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,500
Much of this topic
can be illustrated

5
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,000
by considering various ways

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,900
of entering
this mathematical expression,

7
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,000
which is a definite integral.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,700
One way of entering
this expression is with palettes.

9
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,100
Start by opening
the Basic Math Assistant palette

10
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,900
by choosing Basic Math Assistant
under the Palettes menu.

11
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:26,300
Each section of this palette
shows a grid of buttons

12
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,300
for pasting things
into the notebook.

13
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:29,300
There are keyboard commands

14
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,000
for entering all
of these things as well,

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,600
which will be described
in a moment,

16
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,800
but we will start
with the palette.

17
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,700
All of the buttons
that are needed for this input

18
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,000
are in the section
labeled Typesetting.

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,650
Within this section,
under the first tab

20
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:42,600
are buttons for
mathematical notations

21
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,600
like fractions and exponents,

22
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,800
and under the second tab
are buttons for entering

23
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,200
special symbols
and Greek letters.

24
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,900
Returning to the first tab,
we can start

25
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,500
by clicking the button
that shows the definite integral,

26
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,300
which enters into the notebook
a template with empty boxes,

27
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:59,100
called placeholders, for entering
parts of the integral.

28
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,900
The lower limit of integration

29
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,650
is highlighted
with a colored background,

30
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:04,950
to indicate
where input will appear.

31
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:07,600
In this example, the lower limit
of integration is 0,

32
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,000
so enter 0,

33
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,900
then press the TAB key
to move to the next placeholder,

34
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,200
which is the upper limit
of integration.

35
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,000
The upper limit of integration
in this example

36
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,300
is a special character,

37
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,000
which is the mathematical symbol
for infinity.

38
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,100
To enter that symbol,
click the second tab

39
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,600
to open the grid of buttons
for symbols and Greek letters,

40
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,600
and enter the upper limit
of integration,

41
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,300
by clicking the infinity button
in the palette.

42
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,750
Then press the TAB key
to move to the next placeholder

43
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:35,000
in the template,
which is the integrand.

44
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,200
The first part of the integrand
is an exponential,

45
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,100
which is under the first tab.

46
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,400
Pressing the button
for an exponential

47
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,900
enters that template.

48
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:46,000
Then return to the second tab
to enter the exponential <i>e</i>

49
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,900
and press the TAB key
to move to the next placeholder,

50
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,500
which is the exponent.

51
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,900
Now enter the exponent,
which is –2<i>x</i>.

52
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,300
Continuing to type at this point

53
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,200
would enter more input
into the exponent,

54
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,000
but to continue
with this example,

55
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,400
it is necessary to get out
of the exponent.

56
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,400
The keyboard command
to end the exponent

57
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,000
and move to
the enclosing expression

58
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,600
is CONTROL+SPACE.

59
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,900
So with the insertion point
in the exponent,

60
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,000
press CONTROL+SPACE

61
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,800
and then finish
entering the integrand.

62
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,200
You could also move
the insertion point

63
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,500
out of the exponent
by clicking the mouse

64
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,500
outside of the exponent.

65
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,950
Now press the TAB key
to move to the next placeholder

66
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:23,000
and enter <i>x</i>
to complete the input.

67
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
This is a live input

68
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,200
and can be evaluated
just like any other input

69
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,500
to do that calculation
and get a result.

70
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,500
The input is still not formatted
quite like the initial example.

71
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,400
There are several differences
in alignment

72
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,500
and in the shapes of characters.

73
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,400
Those differences are there
because the example is shown

74
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,500
in a format
called TraditionalForm

75
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,000
and the input
that we just entered

76
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
is shown in StandardForm.

77
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,300
StandardForm can be converted
to TraditionalForm

78
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,000
by selecting the input
and choosing

79
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Convert To ► TraditionalForm
under the Cell menu.

80
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,500
TraditionalForm looks more like
traditional mathematics,

81
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,350
which is frequently desirable,

82
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:57,350
and the only reason

83
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:58,900
that TraditionalForm
isn't the default

84
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:02,000
is that translating traditional
mathematics into computer input

85
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,300
requires a somewhat

86
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,500
elaborate and nonuniform set
of translation rules.

87
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,000
For example, in StandardForm
functions are shown

88
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
with square brackets
around the arguments,

89
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,200
but in TraditionalForm

90
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,000
function arguments
are enclosed in parentheses.

91
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,200
This use of parentheses
is a potential ambiguity, however,

92
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,400
because parentheses
can also indicate

93
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,700
arithmetic grouping

94
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,000
and the computer
cannot always guess correctly

95
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,400
what the parentheses should mean
in every situation.

96
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,500
As a practical matter though,

97
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,650
the rules for translating
TraditionalForm input

98
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:31,650
work pretty well.

99
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:33,500
So if you prefer TraditionalForm,

100
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,000
it is entirely reasonable
to use it,

101
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,900
and if it is only being used
for display and not for input,

102
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,000
than there is no real problem
with it at all.

103
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,800
This input
and all of these notations

104
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,900
can also be entered
using keyboard commands.

105
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,650
One way to learn
about keyboard commands

106
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:48,950
is by hovering the mouse

107
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:51,500
over a corresponding button
in the palette.

108
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,000
For example,
hovering the mouse pointer

109
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,500
over the exponential <i>e</i> button
in this palette

110
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,800
gives a display called a tooltip

111
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,600
that shows the name
of the character,

112
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,200
which is exponential <i>e</i>,

113
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,100
and the keyboard command,
which is ESCAPE+ee+ESCAPE.

114
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,650
Typing ESCAPE+ee+ESCAPE

115
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:09,000
on the keyboard enters
the exponential constant <i>e</i>

116
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,100
that came up in the example.

117
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,500
There are also keyboard commands
for mathematical templates.

118
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,500
For example, under the tab
for typesetting forms,

119
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,000
hovering the mouse
over the button

120
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,900
for entering
a definite integral

121
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:24,000
shows the command
ESCAPE+dintt+ESCAPE,

122
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,500
which can be typed
from the keyboard

123
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,000
to get the definite
integral template.

124
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,450
The names of keyboard commands

125
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:32,000
are chosen to have some
logical way of remembering them.

126
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
For example, the keyboard command
for the integral character

127
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
is ESCAPE+int+ESCAPE

128
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,850
and the keyboard command
for the definite integral template

129
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:42,200
is ESCAPE+dintt+ESCAPE,

130
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:46,500
where "d-i-n-t-t" is short
for definite integral template.

131
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,800
To continue with the input,

132
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,300
enter the lower limit
of integration,

133
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,400
then press the TAB key

134
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,500
to move to the upper limit
of integration.

135
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,700
The keyboard command
for the infinity character

136
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,900
is ESCAPE+inf+ESCAPE.

137
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,800
Then press the TAB key
to move to the integrand.

138
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,500
ESCAPE+ee+ESCAPE
enters the exponential <i>e</i>

139
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,800
and CONTROL+6
gives a template for the exponent.

140
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,400
On common keyboards
the caret character,

141
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,400
which is used in computer code
for exponents,

142
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,400
is on the key for the number 6,

143
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,000
so a good way to remember
CONTROL+6 for an exponent

144
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,100
is that it is the CONTROL key

145
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,500
and the key
with the caret character on it.

146
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,900
Then enter the exponent
and press the TAB key

147
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,500
to move to the last placeholder
and complete the input.

148
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,900
This input could have been
entered in many different ways.

149
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,800
For example,
to enter the exponential

150
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,400
rather than starting
with the template,

151
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,500
we can start with
the exponential <i>e</i> character,

152
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,900
select that character

153
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,200
and then click the button
for the template.

154
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,100
This had the effect of inserting
the exponential <i>e</i> character

155
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,800
in place of the filled
black square

156
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,500
that is shown on the button.

157
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,800
Several of the buttons
in this palette

158
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,000
have placeholders
that are filled black squares

159
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
rather than empty black squares.

160
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,800
The filled black squares
are selection placeholders,

161
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,300
which work just like
the empty square placeholders

162
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,900
except that if something
in the notebook is selected

163
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:57,700
when one of those buttons

164
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:01,300
with a filled black square
selection placeholder is clicked,

165
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,200
then the selected expression
gets inserted

166
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,500
in place of
the selection placeholder.

167
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,650
For example,
the definite integral example

168
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:08,650
could have been entered

169
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:11,500
by starting
with the inner expression.

170
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,900
The button that was used
earlier for entering

171
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,800
the definite integral template
does not have

172
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,800
a filled black square
selection placeholder,

173
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,050
but there is a similar button

174
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:21,200
in the Basic Commands section
of the palette

175
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,500
that does have
a selection placeholder.

176
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,750
To enter the input,
select the expression

177
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,100
and click the button,

178
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,650
which inserts
the selected expression

179
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:31,400
in place
of the selection placeholder.

180
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,600
This template is also different

181
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,500
in that it has
descriptive placeholders

182
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,500
that display as shaded boxes

183
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:40,100
with reminders about the purpose
of each part of the input.

184
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,300
These descriptive placeholders

185
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,300
work just like
the empty box placeholders

186
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:47,400
and can be filled in just as
before to complete the input.

187
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,200
All of these notations
and special characters

188
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,800
can be used in Text cells
and in graphics

189
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,000
and almost anywhere else
in the notebook.

190
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
For example, here is a Text cell

191
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,200
with some mathematical notations
within the text.

192
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,800
This Text cell can be entered

193
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,000
using much the same process
as was used for entering input.

194
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,500
Start with a Text cell
and use either the palette

195
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:10,800
or keyboard commands
to enter mathematical notations.

196
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,800
An important aspect
of this Text cell

197
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,500
is that the formatted mathematics

198
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,800
is actually in a separate cell
called an Inline cell.

199
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,500
Clicking within
the formatted mathematics

200
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,500
changes the background color
to highlight the Inline cell.

201
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,000
To leave the Inline cell
and continue entering text,

202
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,600
you can either
click beyond the Inline cell

203
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,400
or press CONTROL+0,

204
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,000
which is the keyboard command
to end the Inline cell.

205
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,700
In that example, the Inline cell
was created automatically

206
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,500
as soon as some notation
other than text was entered,

207
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,750
but in general it is necessary

208
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,600
to first create
a new Inline cell,

209
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,000
which you can do
by choosing Start Inline Cell

210
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,700
from the Typesetting menu
under the Insert menu,

211
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,400
and right below that
is End Inline Cell,

212
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,800
which is the command
that was used

213
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,000
to end an Inline cell.

214
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,650
The keyboard command
for Start Inline Cell

215
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:55,650
is CONTROL+9

216
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:57,650
and the keyboard command
for End Inline Cell

217
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:58,650
is CONTROL+0.

218
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:00,550
So to enter another Inline cell,

219
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:03,000
press CONTORL+9
to create the cell,

220
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
then enter the fraction,

221
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
press CONTROL+0
to end the inline cell

222
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,900
and return to
the enclosing text cell

223
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,750
and complete the input.

224
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,600
These notations
can also be used in graphics.

225
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,600
For example, this input
uses the Epilog option

226
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,000
to add a formatted label
to a plot.

227
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,400
The label is entered here
just as it would be

228
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,650
in any other input.

229
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:24,000
Keyboard commands
for special characters

230
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
are referred to as aliases.

231
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,800
Many common characters
have aliases

232
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,500
and often several aliases.

233
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,000
For example, the tooltip
for the Greek letter alpha

234
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,400
shows that the long name
of the character

235
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,000
is the capitalized word Alpha,

236
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
which can be entered
by typing backslash,

237
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,200
square bracket,
followed by the long name,

238
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,650
and as soon as the closing
square bracket is entered,

239
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:46,400
the display turns
into the character.

240
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,900
Characters can also be entered
using tech or SGML names.

241
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,500
For example,
typing ESCAPE+BACKSLASH+alpha,

242
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,700
which is the tech name
for this character,

243
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,000
and pressing the ESCAPE key
a second time

244
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,500
gives the same alpha character.

245
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,500
The SGML name,

246
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,450
which comes up
in HTML documents,

247
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:05,000
can be entered as
ESCAPE, ampersand,

248
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,100
then the SGML name
of the character,

249
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,700
which is also Alpha,

250
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,000
followed by a semicolon
and then pressing

251
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,900
the ESCAPE key a second time
to get the character.

252
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,150
So if you already know

253
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:17,150
character names from tech
or from SGML,

254
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,400
you can use those names

255
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,300
to enter characters
in Wolfram Notebooks.

256
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,300
There are many thousands
of special characters.

257
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,800
At the bottom of each grid
of characters

258
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,500
in the basic math
assistant palette

259
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,900
is a button that opens
the Special Characters palette,

260
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,700
which is the same palette
that is opened

261
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:34,000
by choosing Special Character
under the Insert menu.

262
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,400
If you see a character
like this one

263
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,000
and would like to know
how to enter it,

264
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,600
you can select the character

265
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,400
and choose Find Selected Function
from the Help menu

266
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,000
to bring up
the documentation page

267
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,300
for that character,

268
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,300
which for this character

269
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,000
shows the long name
of the character,

270
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,700
which is DoubleLongRightArrow
and the Unicode number

271
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,500
and the alias
and some other information.

272
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,000
Not all characters have aliases

273
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,300
and some less common characters
do not even have long names,

274
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,000
but it is essentially
always possible

275
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,500
to enter a character as Unicode.

276
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,800
For example, backslash, colon,
followed by the Unicode number

277
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,000
gives the double long
right arrow character.

278
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,200
That's the end of the examples
for this section.

279
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,800
You can find more information
in the Wolfram documentation

280
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,300
in this tutorial on
two-dimensional expression input.

281
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,000
This section covered
the basic process

282
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
for entering mathematics
and special characters,

283
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
but there are many details
that can also be controlled

284
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
involving things like the size
and alignment of characters

285
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,600
and ways to customize
the formatting

286
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,000
and customize the handling
of various inputs.

287
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,800
If your application requires
that sort of control,

288
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,300
you can find more information
in the section

289
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:40,000
on math typesetting
options and tweaking

290
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
and in links from this guide page
on defining custom notation.
