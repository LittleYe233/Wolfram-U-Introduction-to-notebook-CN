00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,400
Welcome to this short introduction
to Wolfram Notebooks.

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,000
Wolfram Notebooks
were first released in 1988,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,500
as the user interface
for Wolfram Language systems.

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,500
So, a typical
Wolfram Language session

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,500
might look something like this,

6
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:15,000
with inputs and outputs displayed
in a notebook window.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,700
Wolfram Notebooks
have always been much more

8
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,500
than just a user interface though.

9
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,000
In addition to inputs and outputs,

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,300
the notebook can include
headings and comments,

11
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:23,000
as shown here,

12
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,500
as well as project information
and hyperlinks

13
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,000
and anything else that you
might want put in the document.

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,000
Here is a more finished notebook,

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,300
with notes and tables
and interactive features

16
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,500
like buttons and sliders,

17
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,000
all organized into sections
and subsections.

18
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,000
A Wolfram Notebook like this is

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,700
uniquely itself, a programmable
Wolfram Language expression.

20
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,400
It can be saved to the cloud
for viewing in a web browser

21
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,700
or formatted
as a slide presentation

22
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:49,000
or shared as a standalone
electronic document

23
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,500
or viewed on mobile devices.

24
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,600
And a Wolfram Notebook
can be created

25
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,300
and edited programmatically
from the Wolfram Language,

26
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,300
which enables a broad range
of applications,

27
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,500
like generating
rich reports automatically

28
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,200
or even saving notebooks
as expressions in a blockchain,

29
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,800
for a computational contracts.

30
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,000
To see a few details of how
all of these features come together,

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
consider a project that starts
with an empty notebook.

32
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,800
This first input imports
some data related to earthquakes,

33
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,500
and this next input
organizes that data into a dataset.

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
There are a variety of aids
to help with getting the syntax right

35
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
when entering these inputs.

36
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,800
This next input will give a plot

37
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,400
of the geographic locations
of earthquakes.

38
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,500
And as this input
is being entered,

39
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,000
unmatched brackets
and quote marks

40
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,500
are shown in a different color,

41
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,500
and different types of keywords
are shown in different colors.

42
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,300
And for longer programs,
there are other programming aids

43
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:41,400
like automatic line breaking
and so on.

44
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,300
This shows another one
of those programming aids

45
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:46,000
called command completion,
which displays a menu of choices,

46
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
given the first few letters
in the name of a function.

47
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,600
And after the function is chosen,

48
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,500
you can bring up a menu
of function templates

49
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,300
for the arguments
of the function.

50
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:57,000
This input gives a histogram
of earthquake magnitudes.

51
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,700
Before a project like this
gets very far along,

52
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,800
it can be useful to include notes
and background information

53
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,500
to describe, say,
an overview of the project,

54
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,700
or to give details about
what each calculation is doing.

55
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,400
Notes like that, can be inserted

56
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,500
by clicking anywhere
between the inputs and outputs,

57
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,000
and entering text, much as
you might do in any text editor.

58
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You can indicate
that you are entering text

59
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
by choosing Text
from the Style submenu,

60
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,400
under the format menu

61
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,800
or by using the equivalent
keyboard shortcut.

62
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,800
Eventually the notebook
can become large enough

63
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,000
that it is useful
to add some organization.

64
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,800
There are several ways
of doing that.

65
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,700
Here I will start
by entering a title

66
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:37,000
and then a section heading,
at the start of each new topic.

67
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,500
Section headings
are added much like text,

68
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,700
by clicking where you want
to put a heading

69
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,800
and choosing Section from the
Style submenu of the format menu

70
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,000
or by using the equivalent
keyboard shortcut.

71
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,500
A key feature of notebooks is that
notebooks are structured documents,

72
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:55,300
where everything in the notebook
is organized into units called cells.

73
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,800
There are many different
types of cells.

74
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,500
Inputs are shown in input cells.

75
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,800
Outputs are shown
in output cells.

76
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,500
Text is shown in text cells.

77
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,500
Section headings are shown
in section cells and so on.

78
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Cells are typically identified
by cell brackets,

79
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,800
near the right edge
of the notebook window.

80
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,000
Cells can also be nested.

81
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So, for example,
there is a cell bracket

82
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
that groups each input
with the corresponding output.

83
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
And in this notebook,
for each section heading

84
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,300
there is an outer bracket
that automatically groups

85
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:25,000
the section heading
with all of the cells in that section.

86
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,800
Returning now to the top
of the notebook,

87
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,500
one useful feature
of grouped cells

88
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,500
is that cell groups
can be opened and closed.

89
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,900
For example,
double-clicking on

90
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,000
the outer section cell bracket
in this notebook

91
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
closes the section cells
to show only the section headings,

92
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
which gives this outline overview
of the notebook.

93
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,300
For many projects,
it is convenient to start

94
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:46,200
with an outline like this
and then proceed with the project

95
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,000
by entering content
within that outline.

96
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Closed cells can be reopened

97
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
by double-clicking
on the same cell bracket

98
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
or by clicking this icon
in the heading of the closed cell.

99
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,800
Notebooks support
many other formatting features.

100
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,500
So far, this notebook has only
been shown with the default styles.

101
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,000
But the notebook can be displayed
in a variety of formats

102
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,800
by choosing from
different stylesheets,

103
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,500
like the ones shown here,
or by setting up your own styles.

104
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,700
Another important feature
of notebooks

105
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,500
is support
for mathematical typesetting,

106
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:19,800
which is useful for projects that
involve any sort of mathematics.

107
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,000
The default mathematical typesetting
will look more like this,

108
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,500
with slightly different typeface
and formatting,

109
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,000
which has some advantages,

110
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,800
or there are options
to make the display

111
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,000
look more like what you might find
in a traditional textbook.

112
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,000
All of this is fully integrated
with the rest of the system,

113
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
and can be used for input or output
or anywhere else in a notebook.

114
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,500
You can also create tables
and itemized lists

115
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,800
and automatic numbering

116
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,500
and other structures
that you might expect to find

117
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,500
in a modern typesetting system.

118
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,400
Notebooks also support
interactive controls,

119
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,700
like buttons and sliders.

120
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,600
Here, for example, is a display
that provides sliders

121
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,800
for selecting a range
of earthquake magnitudes

122
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,000
and buttons for selecting
the year.

123
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Controls like these can be used
to set up interactive documents

124
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,500
so that anyone using the notebook
can explore data

125
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,000
or choose the content
that they want to see

126
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
or even control
complicated calculations

127
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,500
right from within the notebook.

128
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,500
As noted earlier,
there are a number of ways

129
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,000
of sharing notebooks
or saving notebooks to the cloud.

130
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Under the File menu,
you can choose save to cloud

131
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
and then reload the notebook
from the cloud,

132
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
or here I will choose
publish to cloud,

133
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
which saves a notebook that
can be viewed in any web browser.

134
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,000
This shows that notebook
in a web browser,

135
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
where the notebook
looks and behaves

136
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,500
much like the original notebook,

137
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,000
including all
of the interactive features.

138
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
So, this is a dynamic document.

139
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,500
Notebooks can also be shared
just as they are,

140
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,700
as electronic documents,

141
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,800
and viewed using any
Wolfram Language system,

142
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,600
or using the free
Wolfram Notebook player.

143
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,000
This shows that notebook viewed
in the Wolfram Player,

144
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
which again behaves much like
the original notebook,

145
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,400
except for a different border
around the window.

146
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,500
With a few clicks of the mouse,

147
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,000
this notebook can also
be converted to a slideshow,

148
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,300
with each section
in a separate slide.

149
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,500
For this notebook,
that can be done

150
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:04,200
by setting the style sheet
to a PresenterTools style,

151
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,000
and then setting the screen
environment to Slideshow Working,

152
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,300
to access the tools
for editing the presentation.

153
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,500
One of those tools
brings up this dialog box

154
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,300
to get a separate slide
for each section.

155
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,700
Then click Start Presentation
to show the slides.

156
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,800
All of the editing and interactive
features work in the presentation

157
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,800
just as they do
in the original notebook.

158
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,000
So basically, Wolfram Notebooks

159
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
provide a system for organizing
projects and collaboration,

160
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,500
all the way from initial concept
through to distribution of reports

161
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,500
or presentations
or sharing in the cloud

162
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,000
or even as Wolfram Language
expressions embedded in code.

163
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,700
There is much more to be said

164
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,000
about all of the features
that came up in this short video.

165
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,400
You can find more information
in online documentation

166
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,000
or in other videos
on Wolfram Notebooks.
