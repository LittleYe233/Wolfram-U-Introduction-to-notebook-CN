00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
This section is about
customizing the overall style

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:03,500
of Wolfram Notebooks

3
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,100
and the styles of the cells

4
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,200
and the content
within a notebook.

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,900
Style here refers
to the appearance

6
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,700
and behavior of things
in a notebook.

7
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,800
For example,
here is a typical notebook,

8
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,300
which like all Wolfram Notebooks
is made up of units called cells,

9
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,000
which are identified
by these brackets

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,800
on the right side of the window.

11
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,000
Cells have different styles.

12
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The first cell
has a style called Title,

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,300
the style of the second cell
is Section

14
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,300
and this notebook also contains
two Text cells

15
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,300
and two Input cells
and two Output cells.

16
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,300
Each cell style
uses different colors

17
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,600
and different fonts
and font sizes.

18
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,000
Text cells use different
indentation than Section cells,

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,800
and Input and Output cells
have these labels

20
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,600
with the input
and output number.

21
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,000
All of these things are part
of the style of the cell.

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,400
A notebook like this
can be created

23
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,500
by choosing New
from the File menu

24
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,500
to get a new notebook, and
typing into the empty notebook.

25
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,800
Input by default
goes into an Input Cell

26
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,300
and if I evaluate that input

27
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,000
the result is displayed
in an Output cell.

28
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,500
Subsequent inputs and outputs

29
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,000
give additional Input
and Output cells.

30
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The horizontal line
after the last output

31
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,500
is the Cell Insertion Bar.

32
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,500
This is where a new cell
will appear if I start typing.

33
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,900
To put a cell somewhere else,

34
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,000
I can click to position
the cell insertion bar

35
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,300
anywhere between
the existing cells.

36
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,000
The available cell styles
for this notebook

37
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,300
are shown in the Style submenu
of the Format menu.

38
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,500
For example, to add a Title cell

39
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,800
I can click to position
the cell insertion bar

40
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,300
at the top of the notebook,

41
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:32,300
choose title from the Style
submenu and enter the title.

42
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,400
To enter the Section Cell,

43
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,700
I will choose Section
from the Style submenu

44
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,600
and enter the name
of the section.

45
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,000
Common cell styles
also have keyboard shortcuts,

46
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
which are listed
in the Style submenu.

47
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
For example, to add a Text cell

48
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,500
I will here use
the keyboard shortcut

49
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,500
and then enter the contents
of the cell.

50
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,500
The style of a cell can also be
changed after the cell is created.

51
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,800
For example,
to insert another Text cell

52
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,000
I can position
the cell insertion bar

53
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,500
where I want the new cell and
enter the contents of the cell.

54
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,500
Right now, this is an Input cell,
since that is the default,

55
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,800
but I can convert it
to a Text cell

56
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,600
by choosing Text
from the Style submenu

57
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,300
or by typing
the keyboard shortcut,

58
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,500
and the cell is converted
to a Text cell.

59
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,500
Actually if I just start typing
ordinary text into an Input cell,

60
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,000
like this, the system
typically recognizes that

61
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,800
whatever is being entered
is not computer input

62
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,800
and puts up this menu

63
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,000
offering to treat the input
in some other way.

64
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,200
One of the choices
on that menu is text,

65
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,800
which converts the cell
into a Text cell,

66
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,800
so that is yet another way
to get a Text cell.

67
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,000
Almost everything in this display
can be customized.

68
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,800
For example,
to emphasize some bit of text,

69
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,500
I could select that text
and change the style

70
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,700
using items
under the Format menu.

71
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:47,800
For example,
this sets the text color to red

72
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,700
and the text
to a somewhat larger size.

73
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,000
You can also change
the styles for entire cells.

74
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
For example, to change the styles
for the Section cell

75
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,700
I can select the cell bracket

76
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,800
and again use items
from the Format menu

77
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,300
to change the styles.

78
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,300
For example,

79
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,700
this sets the background
of the cell to light orange

80
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,000
and the text color to black.

81
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
All of these changes work
by controlling options

82
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
in the underlying
cell expressions.

83
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You can see
the options settings explicitly

84
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,100
by choosing Show Expression
from the Cell menu,

85
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,600
which displays
the underlying cell expression.

86
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,300
For example,
with that Section cell selected

87
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,100
I can choose Show Expression
to see the cell expression,

88
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,500
which shows the content
of the cell

89
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,500
and the argument that identifies
this as a Section cell

90
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,500
and the font color option

91
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,700
to specify that the text
should be shown in black

92
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:34,700
and the background option

93
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,300
to specify
the light orange background.

94
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,600
This particular RGB
color expression

95
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,600
is how colors are specified
in notebooks.

96
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,000
I can also type options
into the cell directly.

97
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,400
For example, here I will insert
the TextAlignment option

98
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,500
and specify Center
as the value of the option.

99
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,600
Then choose Show Expression
from the Cell menu

100
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,000
to reformat the cell

101
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
and the display shows the effect
of all of those options settings,

102
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,500
including the effect
of the TextAlignment option

103
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,000
to center the text.

104
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,500
There are actually many hundreds
of options like this.

105
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,300
The general tool for setting
options is the Option Inspector,

106
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,200
which is opened
by choosing Option Inspector

107
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,000
from the Format menu or by using
the equivalent keyboard shortcut.

108
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
For example, entering background
into the search box

109
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,500
in the Option Inspector

110
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,000
brings up the entry
for the Background option,

111
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,100
which here shows
the value of this option

112
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:27,000
that was just entered
using the Format menu.

113
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,700
The icon with the X
on the left side

114
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,500
of the Option Inspector entry

115
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,000
indicates that this option
is set within the selection.

116
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,500
Clicking that icon
removes that option setting,

117
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:40,000
which returns the background
to the default value,

118
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
which for this cell
is a plain white background.

119
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,800
You can also enter
options settings

120
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,000
using the Option Inspector.

121
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
For example, there is an option
called CellDingbat

122
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,500
that can be used to add
something called a cell dingbat,

123
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,000
which is a kind of marker
on the left side of the cell.

124
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,500
Clicking this little arrow

125
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,000
brings up a menu of choices
for the cell dingbat.

126
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,500
Here I will choose
Filled Small Circle,

127
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,400
which changes the value

128
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,000
of the option
in the Option Inspector

129
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
and adds a filled small circle
on the left side of the cell.

130
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
In the upper left corner
of the Option Inspector

131
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,500
there is another important menu
for choosing whether options

132
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,500
should be shown
for the thing that is selected

133
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,000
or for the entire
selected notebook,

134
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,400
or if the Option Inspector
should show global preferences.

135
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,600
For example,
choosing Selected Notebook

136
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,800
causes the Option Inspector
to show options

137
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,700
for the entire notebook,
not just for the selected cell.

138
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:32,000
For example, if I now set
the background option

139
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
to some other color,

140
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,400
that will set the background
for the entire notebook

141
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,000
and not just
for the selected cell.

142
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
For now I will click the X
in the Option Inspector

143
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
to set the background color
back to the default.

144
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,800
Rather than setting options for
individual selections like this,

145
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,200
probably the most common way
of customizing a notebook

146
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,600
is by choosing from
predefined cell styles

147
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,400
and predefined stylesheets.

148
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,000
Every notebook has a stylesheet.

149
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,800
The stylesheet for a notebook
can be set

150
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,800
by choosing a stylesheet
from the Stylesheet submenu

151
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,400
under the Format menu.

152
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,500
This particular notebook
uses a stylesheet called Default,

153
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,600
which is the item
that is checked in this menu.

154
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,500
All of the options for the cells
in this notebook

155
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,300
are set up in that stylesheet.

156
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,500
There are quite a few other
stylesheets to choose from.

157
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,800
For example,
this switches the stylesheet

158
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,400
for this notebook
to JournalArticle.

159
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,000
This is still the same notebook,

160
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
but the display uses
different fonts

161
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,100
and different font sizes

162
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,000
and the title is centered
rather than aligned on the left

163
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
and there are
many other differences.

164
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,800
Here is another stylesheet
called Garnet

165
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,800
from the PresenterTools submenu.

166
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,600
PresenterTools styles are styles

167
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,000
that can be used to show
this notebook as a slideshow,

168
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
which will be discussed
in a later section.

169
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,600
That's the end of the examples
for this section.

170
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,600
The next section
is about editing stylesheets,

171
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,000
which you can do
to customize existing styles

172
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,500
or create new cell styles
or to design your own stylesheets.

173
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,200
There are also hundreds
of cell options

174
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,200
and notebook options

175
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,500
beyond the options
that came up in this section.

176
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,800
You can find more information
about other options
