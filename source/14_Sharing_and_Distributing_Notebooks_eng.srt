00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,900
This section of Introduction
to Wolfram Notebooks

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:04,800
is about sharing notebooks
with other people

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,700
and distributing notebooks
publicly over the internet.

4
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,500
A notebook can be shared
either from a desktop application

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,450
or from the Wolfram Cloud.

6
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:14,600
This happens to be
a notebook in a web browser

7
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,200
that is signed into
a Wolfram Cloud Account.

8
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,300
At the top of this page

9
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,700
are buttons labeled
Share and Publish.

10
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,200
Share is used for sharing
the notebook with specific people

11
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,300
and Publish is used

12
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,000
for making the notebook
more publicly available.

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Clicking the Share button
opens a dialog box

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
where you can enter
an email address.

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,950
Clicking Share
in that dialog box

16
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:36,000
puts a link to this notebook
in the Wolfram Cloud Account

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
that is associated
with that address

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,100
and sends an email notification
to that address.

19
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,200
The contents of that email
will look something like this,

20
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,000
with a button that can be clicked
to see the notebook.

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,300
If the owner of that account
is not already signed in

22
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,000
to that Wolfram Cloud Account,

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,200
clicking that button
will first bring up a dialog box

24
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,500
for signing in,

25
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,900
and after that
the notebook will be displayed

26
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:58,550
in that Wolfram Cloud Account.

27
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:00,500
Returning to the notebook
in the original account,

28
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,100
clicking the Publish button
brings up a different dialog box

29
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,450
for making the notebook
publicly available.

30
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:07,500
Clicking the Publish button
in that dialog box

31
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,650
opens a second dialog box
with a URL

32
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,800
that anyone could use
to view this notebook.

33
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,600
To see the notebook,
copy the URL, open a web browser

34
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,300
and go to
the corresponding webpage,

35
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:22,000
which displays the notebook
in a web browser.

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,950
The notebook can be viewed here
in the web browser,

37
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:25,500
and dynamic content also works,

38
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,300
like the controls
in this Manipulate result.

39
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,900
This display is not editable,
but it does include buttons

40
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,450
for making a copy
of the notebook

41
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:33,500
that can be edited.

42
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,450
For example,
clicking the Download button

43
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:38,200
would download a copy
of the notebook to the desktop,

44
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,300
where the copy could be opened
and edited in Wolfram Desktop,

45
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,500
just like any other notebook.

46
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,800
There was no need to sign in
to a Wolfram Cloud Account

47
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,900
to see this notebook,

48
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,900
so the notebook is currently
being viewed anonymously,

49
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,700
but the notebook can be copied
to a Wolfram Cloud Account

50
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,800
either by clicking
the sign-in button

51
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,000
or by clicking
the Make Your Own Copy button.

52
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,650
For example,
since this web browser

53
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:01,300
is not already signed in
to a Wolfram Cloud Account,

54
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,000
clicking
the Make Your Own Copy button

55
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,600
opens a dialog box
for signing in,

56
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,600
and after signing in

57
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,300
the copy is displayed
in the web browser,

58
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:11,000
where it can be edited
just like any other notebook

59
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,450
in this account.

60
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:16,200
As noted earlier, this notebook
can also be published or shared

61
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,600
from the desktop.

62
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,600
For example,

63
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,900
starting now with this notebook
on the desktop,

64
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,000
the notebook can be made
publicly available

65
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,800
by selecting Publish to Cloud
from the File menu,

66
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,000
which opens a dialog box

67
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,400
much like the dialog box
that came up earlier

68
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,500
for choosing a file name

69
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,100
and for choosing whether
or not to require a password.

70
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,300
Clicking the Publish button

71
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,000
copies the notebook
from the desktop

72
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,400
to the cloud and displays a URL.

73
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,200
As before, anyone with that URL

74
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,500
and a web browser
connected to the internet

75
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,600
could see the notebook.

76
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,400
The dialog box
also includes code

77
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,700
for embedding the notebook
in another document.

78
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,600
As a simple example
of how that can work,

79
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,900
here is a text editor

80
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,800
with raw HTML code
for a webpage.

81
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,600
The code from the dialog box
can be pasted into the HTML file

82
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,300
in the text editor,
then save the HTML file

83
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,100
and open it in a web browser,

84
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:07,200
which shows the notebook
rendered in the web browser.

85
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,400
This webpage also includes
a button near the bottom

86
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,400
that can be clicked
to download the notebook

87
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,900
or copy it
to a Wolfram Cloud Account.

88
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,200
You could also include
your own link

89
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,200
for downloading the notebook
directly from your computer.

90
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,850
Either way,
the downloaded notebook

91
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:21,300
can be displayed on the desktop

92
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,900
using a Wolfram Desktop
application

93
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,500
or using
the free Wolfram Player,

94
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,750
which can be downloaded from
the Wolfram Research website.

95
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,200
For example, this shows
the downloaded notebook

96
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,800
in Wolfram Player.

97
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,900
From the desktop,

98
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,000
you can also share the notebook
with specific people,

99
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,900
like the sharing
that was shown earlier

100
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,500
from my Wolfram Cloud Account.

101
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,500
For example,
evaluating CloudShare

102
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,700
with an email address
in this notebook

103
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,500
uploads the notebook
to Wolfram Cloud

104
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,000
and sends an email notification
to that address

105
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,700
with a link to the notebook
in the cloud.

106
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,000
The CloudShare function
is essentially

107
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,300
just a different way
of doing the same operations

108
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:59,500
that were done earlier
using the Share dialog box.

109
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,400
The return value
from the CloudShare function

110
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,950
is a cloud object expression,

111
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:05,100
which represents
the uploaded notebook.

112
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,300
CloudObject expressions
are useful to know about

113
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,800
in part because the permissions
for accessing the notebook

114
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,100
are stored as options
of that expression.

115
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,900
For example,
the Permissions option

116
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,400
of this CloudObject expression

117
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,000
includes the email address
where the notebook was shared

118
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,800
and a list of permissions.

119
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,450
This works much like
Permissions for files

120
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:23,950
and common operating systems,
where their permissions

121
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:26,000
are typically associated
with each file,

122
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,950
a difference here being
that you can specify

123
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:30,900
different permissions
for each individual user.

124
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,700
The default permissions
give Read, Write

125
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,800
and Execute permission
to the owner,

126
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,000
and permission to read
and interact with the notebook,

127
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,700
which permits the use
of interactive controls

128
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,000
in the account
where the notebook is shared.

129
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Those permissions
can be changed.

130
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,700
For example, this input
gives that account read, write

131
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:50,550
and execute permission
for the notebook.

132
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:51,550
To see that notebook

133
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:52,900
in the account
where it was shared,

134
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,600
you could click the link
in the email notification,

135
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,700
but a link to that notebook

136
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,000
will actually already be
available in that account.

137
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Here, for example,
is a web browser

138
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
that is logged into
that account.

139
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,600
Clicking either the Files button
or the My Files icon

140
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,700
opens a file browser

141
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,900
where you can navigate
to a directory of files

142
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,300
that have been shared with you.

143
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,300
Right now the most recent file
in that directory

144
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,600
is the notebook
that was just shared,

145
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,500
which you can open
for viewing in this account.

146
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,000
As expected from the permissions
that were set earlier,

147
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,900
the notebook can be viewed here

148
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,800
and interactive controls work

149
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,100
and the notebook can be edited.

150
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,200
The notebook cannot, however,
be shared or published,

151
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,800
since the notebook
is not owned by this account.

152
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,700
There is not a Share button
or a Publish button

153
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,000
at the top of this window,

154
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,700
but the notebook
can be duplicated here,

155
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,900
by choosing Duplicate
from the File menu,

156
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,700
which creates a new notebook.

157
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,300
Clicking Open new file,
opens the new notebook,

158
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,900
which is owned
by this Wolfram Cloud Account

159
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,200
and which can be shared
or published.

160
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,200
For example,

161
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,900
clicking the Share button
opens the dialog box for sharing,

162
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,000
where you can enter the name
of another account,

163
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
indicate edit permission
for that account

164
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,700
and click the Share button
to share the notebook.

165
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,000
One important feature
of this system

166
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,800
is that the shared notebook
will be a link to this notebook,

167
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,650
so both accounts will,
in effect,

168
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:07,300
be viewing the same notebook.

169
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,700
Here is that notebook
in the other account.

170
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,200
Since the notebook is still open

171
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,000
in the owner's
Wolfram Cloud Account,

172
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,600
this display includes a message

173
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,300
indicating that the file
is currently locked,

174
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,800
since it is already open
for editing in another account.

175
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,200
If the other account signs out,

176
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,000
then since the notebook was
shared with editing permission,

177
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,900
the notebook could be edited
in this account

178
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,800
and any changes
would affect both notebooks.

179
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,200
This is convenient if two

180
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,400
or more people are working
with the same notebook,

181
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,200
but you could also make
your own copy of the notebook.

182
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,300
That's the end of the examples
for this section.

183
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,500
This section is mostly about

184
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,300
sharing and distributing
entire notebooks,

185
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,900
but you can also share
pieces of notebooks.

186
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:47,150
For example, clicking this icon
within a cell

187
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:48,600
opens a menu
where you can choose

188
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,900
to share this cell,

189
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,200
which leads to a dialog box
with a URL

190
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,500
that can be used to view

191
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,700
the contents of that cell
in a web browser.

192
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,000
More generally,
the Wolfram Cloud

193
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,300
supports a whole range of tools

194
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,000
for putting data
and apps and APIs

195
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,200
and things other than notebooks
on the internet.

196
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,500
You can find more information

197
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,400
about the operations
in this section

198
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,000
and about all
of those other features

199
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,800
by following links
to cloud-related topics

200
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,500
in the Wolfram documentation,
starting with this guide page

201
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,800
on cloud functions
and deployment.
